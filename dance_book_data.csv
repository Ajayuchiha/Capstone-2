Lp6ZWXUI6YIC,dance,Dance Dance Dance,No Subtitle,Haruki Murakami,"*PRE-ORDER HARUKI MURAKAMI’S NEW NOVEL, THE CITY AND ITS UNCERTAIN WALLS, NOW* An assault on the senses, part murder mystery, part metaphysical speculation; a fable for our times as catchy as a rock song blasting from the window of a sports car. High-class call girls billed to Mastercard. A psychic 13-year-old dropout with a passion for Talking Heads. A hunky matinee idol doomed to play dentists and teachers. A one-armed beach-combing poet, an uptight hotel clerk and one very bemused narrator caught in the web of advanced capitalist mayhem. Combine this offbeat cast of characters with Murakami's idiosyncratic prose and out comes Dance Dance Dance.

Stripped of their association with the temple and the court, classical dance traditions in India went through a series of unprecedented change in the period marking the last few years of British rule and thereafter. From becoming part of the nationalist struggle when India was trying to rediscover its lost identity, to sharing the international stage today with dance forms from all over the world, the last sixty-six years have seen many changes in perspective and presentation of Indian Classical Dance some intentional, others involuntary. While looking at these years closely and their impact on dance forms, one realises that this is a phase in an ongoing process, with each new generation of dancers and musicians adding to an already rich tapestry of tradition.""","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9383098643'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789383098644'}]",False,False,0,Dance,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mTHwrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mTHwrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2015,Unknown Publisher

JS_pCAAAQBAJ,dance,Movement and Mimesis,The Idea of Dance in the Sanskritic Tradition,Mandakranta Bose,"The most comprehensive view of the evolution of dancing in India is one that is derived from Sanskrit textual sources. These texts are the basic material that students of the dance in India must examine in order to uncover its past. Since the rebirth of informed interest in dancing in early twentieth century, its antiquity has been acknowledged but precisely what the art was in antiquity remains unclear. Discovering the oldest forms of dancing in India requires, as do other historical quests, a reconstruction of the past and, again as in other historical investigations, the primary sources of knowledge are records from the past. In this case the records are treatises and manuals in Sanskrit that discuss and describe dancing. These are the sources that the present work sets out to mine. These texts taken collectively are more than records of a particular state of the art. They testify to the growth of the theory and practice of the art and thus establish it as an evolving rather than a fixed art form that changed as much in response to its own expanding aesthetic boundaries as to parallel or complementary forms of dance, drama and music that impinged upon it as India's social and political situation changed. When we place the Sanskrit treatises in chronological sequence it becomes clear that the understanding of the art has changed through time, in its infancy as well as in maturer periods.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789401135948'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9401135940'}]",False,True,343,Philosophy,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JS_pCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JS_pCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,4200.8,INR,4200.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JS_pCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-JS_pCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2012,Springer Science & Business Media

KnoyBgAAQBAJ,dance,Why We Dance,A Philosophy of Bodily Becoming,Kimerer L. LaMothe,"Within intellectual paradigms that privilege mind over matter, dance has long appeared as a marginal, derivative, or primitive art. Drawing support from theorists and artists who embrace matter as dynamic and agential, this book offers a visionary definition of dance that illuminates its constitutive work in the ongoing evolution of human persons. Why We Dance introduces a philosophy of bodily becoming that posits bodily movement as the source and telos of human life. Within this philosophy, dance appears as an activity that humans evolved to do as the enabling condition of their best bodily becoming. Weaving theoretical reflection with accounts of lived experience, this book positions dance as a catalyst in the development of human consciousness, compassion, ritual proclivity, and ecological adaptability. Aligning with trends in new materialism, affect theory, and feminist philosophy, as well as advances in dance and religious studies, this work reveals the vital role dance can play in reversing the trajectory of ecological self-destruction along which human civilization is racing.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780231538886'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '023153888X'}]",True,False,305,Philosophy,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KnoyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KnoyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2341.0,INR,2341.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KnoyBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-KnoyBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2015,Columbia University Press
gPQcAgAAQBAJ,dance,Dance Circles,"Movement, Morality and Self-fashioning in Urban Senegal",Hélène Neveu Kringelbach,"Senegal has played a central role in contemporary dance due to its rich performing traditions, as well as strong state patronage of the arts, first under French colonialism and later in the postcolonial era. In the 1980s, when the Senegalese economy was in decline and state fundingwithdrawn, European agencies used the performing arts as a tool in diplomacy. This had a profound impact on choreographic production and arts markets throughout Africa. In Senegal, choreographic performers have taken to contemporary dance, while continuing to engage with neo-traditional performance, regional genres like the sabar, and the popular dances they grew up with. A historically informed ethnography of creativity, agency, and the fashioning of selves through the different life stages in urban Senegal, this book explores the significance of this multiple engagement with dance in a context of economic uncertainty and rising concerns over morality in the public space.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781782381488'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1782381481'}]",True,True,252,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gPQcAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gPQcAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3534.68,INR,3534.68,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gPQcAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gPQcAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013,Berghahn Books

pGOHDgAAQBAJ,dance,The Midnight Dance,No Subtitle,Nikki Katz,"Set against the fascinating and moody backdrop of a mysterious boarding school, this intricately crafted novel is filled with magical realism, gothic settings, and the perfect hint of romance. Seventeen-year-old Penny is a lead dancer at the Grande Teatro, a finishing school where she and eleven other young women are training to become the finest ballerinas in Italy. Tucked deep in the woods, the school is overseen by the mysterious and handsome young Master, who keeps the girls ensconced in the estate – and in the only life Penny has ever known. But when flashes of memories – memories of a life very different from the one she thinks she’s been leading – start to appear, Penny begins to question the Grande Teatro and the motivations of Master. With a kind and attractive kitchen boy, Cricket, at her side, Penny vows to escape the confines of her school and the strict rules that dictate every step she takes.

This is a stunning novel about spiritual awakening, the power of art, and above all, the courage and resilience of the human spirit. Veda, a classical dance prodigy in India, lives and breathes dance—so when an accident leaves her a below-knee amputee, her dreams are shattered. For a girl who’s grown used to receiving applause for her dance prowess and flexibility, adjusting to a prosthetic leg is painful and humbling. But Veda refuses to let her disability rob her of her dreams, and she starts all over again, taking beginner classes with the youngest dancers. Then Veda meets Govinda, a young man who approaches dance as a spiritual pursuit. As their relationship deepens, Veda reconnects with the world around her, and begins to discover who she is and what dance truly means to her.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698158269'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698158261'}]",True,False,322,Young Adult Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tRZmAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tRZmAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",1,5.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,644.81,INR,322.4,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tRZmAQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-tRZmAQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2014,Penguin

Written by eminent and emergent scholars and practitioners of Indian dance, the articles make dance a foundational socio-cultural and aesthetic phenomena that reflects and impacts upon various cultural intercourses -- from art and architecture to popular culture, and social justice issues. They also highlight the interplay of various frameworks: global, national, and local/indigenous for studying these diverse performance contexts, using dance as a critical lens to analyse current debates on nationalism, transnationalism, gender and sexuality, and postcolonial politics. At the performace level, some articles question the accepted divisions of Indian dance (‘classical’, ‘folk’, and ‘popular’) and critique the dominant values associated with classical dance forms. Finally, the book brings together both experiential and objective dimensions of bodily knowledge through dance.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781136516139'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1136516131'}]",False,True,333,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_QDgCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_QDgCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2012,Routledge

Edited, and with commentary by Amanda Vaill, author of Robbins's biography, Somewhere, 2006 (""I can't imagine a better book about Robbins ever being written""--Terry Teachout, chief drama critic, The Wall Street Journal). He was famous for reinventing the Broadway musical, creating a vernacular American ballet, pushing the art form to new boundaries where it had never gone before, integrating dance seamlessly with character, story and music, and as Associate Artistic Director, Ballet Master, and Co-Artistic Director, with George Balanchine, shaping the New York City Ballet with daring and brio for more than five decades through his often startling choreography in ballet's classical idiom. He was known as the king of Broadway, the most sought-after director-choreographer and show doctor who gave shape to On the Town (1944), Call Me Madam (1950), The King and I (1951), Wonderful Town (1953), Peter Pan (1954), The Pajama Game (1954), Silk Stockings (1955), West Side Story (1957), Gypsy (1959), A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962), Funny Girl (1964), Fiddler on the Roof (1964), and many other classic musicals, winning four Tony Awards, two Oscars, and an Emmy.

-mIdyTLcUE8C,dance,Apollo's Angels,A History Of Ballet,Jennifer Homans,"Apollo's Angels is a major new history of classical ballet. It begins in the courts of Europe, where ballet was an aspect of aristocratic etiquette and a political event as much as it was an art. The story takes the reader from the sixteenth century through to our own time, from Italy and France to Britain, Denmark, Russia and contemporary America. The reader learns how ballet reflected political and cultural upheavals, how dance and dancers were influenced by the Renaissance and French Classicism, by Revolution and Romanticism, by Expressionism and Bolshevism, Modernism and the Cold War. Homans shows how and why 'the steps' were never just the steps: they were a set of beliefs and a way of life. She takes the reader into the lives of dancers and traces the formal evolution of technique, choreography and performance. Her book ends by looking at the contemporary crisis in ballet now that 'the masters are dead and gone' and offers a passionate plea for the centrality of classical dance in our civilization. Apollo's Angels is a book with broad popular appeal: beautifully written and illustrated, it is essential reading for anyone interested in history, culture and art.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781847084545'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1847084540'}]",True,True,487,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-mIdyTLcUE8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-mIdyTLcUE8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1902.0,INR,1902.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-mIdyTLcUE8C&rdid=book--mIdyTLcUE8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013,Granta Books

This text uses interview and observation data to analyze the conditions that encourage some boys and young men to become involved in this widely unconventional activity, and the ways through which they negotiate the gendered and sexual attachments of their professional identity. Most importantly, the book analyzes the opportunities male dancers find to develop a reflexive habitus, engage in gender transgressive acts and experiment with their sexuality. At the same time, it approaches gender and sexuality as embodied, and therefore as parts of identity that are not as easily amendable. This book will be of interest to scholars in Gender and Sexuality Studies as well as Dance and Performance Studies.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783030772185'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3030772187'}]",True,True,189,Social Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lSc9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lSc9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,7563.8,INR,7563.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lSc9EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-lSc9EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Springer Nature

'If you're the sort of guy who raids the refrigerators of silent kitchens at three o'clock in the morning, you can only write accordingly. That's who I am.' Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973 are Haruki Murakami's earliest novels. They follow the fortunes of the narrator and his friend, known only by his nickname, the Rat. In Hear the Wind Sing the narrator is home from college on his summer break. He spends his time drinking beer and smoking in J's Bar with the Rat, listening to the radio, thinking about writing and the women he has slept with, and pursuing a relationship with a girl with nine fingers. Three years later, in Pinball, 1973, he has moved to Tokyo to work as a translator and live with indistinguishable twin girls, but the Rat has remained behind, despite his efforts to leave both the town and his girlfriend. The narrator finds himself haunted by memories of his own doomed relationship but also, more bizarrely, by his short-lived obsession with playing pinball in J's Bar. This sends him on a quest to find the exact model of pinball machine he had enjoyed playing years earlier: the three-flipper Spaceship. *PRE-ORDER HARUKI MURAKAMI’S NEW NOVEL, THE CITY AND ITS UNCERTAIN WALLS, NOW*","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781448190966'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1448190967'}]",True,False,338,Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WMDTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WMDTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,353.11,INR,247.18,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WMDTBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WMDTBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2015,Random House

tCQlDwAAQBAJ,dance,Dance and Organization,Integrating Dance Theory and Methods into the Study of Management,Brigitte Biehl,"Dance and Organisation is the first comprehensive work to integrate dance theory and methods into the study of management, which have developed an interest in the arts and the humanities. Dance represents dynamics and change and puts the moving body at the centre, which has been ignored and oppressed by traditional management theory. ‘Being’ a leader however also means to ‘move’ like one, and critical lessons can be learned from ballerinas and modern dancers. Leadership is a dialogue, as in the work of musicians, conductors and DJs who manage groups without words. Movement in organisational space, in a museum or a techno club can be understood as a choreography and site-specific performance. Movement also is practically used for leadership and employee development workshops and can be deployed as an organisational research method. By taking a firm interdisciplinary stance in dance studies and organisational research to explore management topics, reflecting on practitioner accounts and research projects, the book seeks to make an innovative contribution to our understanding of the moving body, generating new insights on teamwork, leadership, gender in management, organisational space, training and research methods. It comprises an important contribution to the organizational behaviour and critical management studies disciplines, and looks to push the boundaries of the academic literature.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781317387923'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1317387929'}]",False,True,205,Business & Economics,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tCQlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tCQlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3138.8,INR,3138.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tCQlDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-tCQlDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2017,Taylor & Francis
--6SEAAAQBAJ,dance,The Dancer's Voice,Performance and Womanhood in Transnational India,Rumya Sree Putcha,"In The Dancer’s Voice Rumya Sree Putcha theorizes how the Indian classical dancer performs the complex dynamics of transnational Indian womanhood. Putcha argues that the public persona of the Indian dancer has come to represent India in the global imagination—a representation that supports caste hierarchies and Hindu ethnonationalism, as well as white supremacist model minority narratives. Generations of Indian women have been encouraged to embody the archetype of the dancer, popularized through film cultures from the 1930s to the present. Through analyses of films, immigration and marriage laws, histories of caste and race, advertising campaigns, and her own family’s heirlooms, photographs, and memories, Putcha reveals how women’s citizenship is based on separating their voices from their bodies. In listening closely to and for the dancer’s voice, she offers a new way to understand the intersections of body, voice, performance, caste, race, gender, and nation.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781478023760'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1478023767'}]",True,True,138,Social Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=--6SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=--6SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2523.3,INR,2523.3,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=--6SEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book---6SEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022,Duke University Press

By closely analyzing performances by well-known European and American choreographers such as Meg Stuart, William Forsythe, Xavier Le Roy, Jared Gradinger and Angela Schubot, this book investigates their usage of touch on the level of movement, experience and affect. Building on the proposition that touch is more than the moment of bodily contact, the author demonstrates the concept of touch as an interplay of movements and multiple relations of proximity. Egert employs both depth, using close descriptions and analyses of dance performances with theoretical investigations of touch, with breadth, working across the fields of performance and dance studies, philosophy and cultural theory. Suitable for scholars and practitioners in the fields of dance and performance studies, Moving Relation uses a process-oriented notion of touch to reevaluate key concepts such as the body, rhythm, emotional expression, subjectivity and audience perception.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780429632372'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0429632371'}]",True,True,245,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dLauDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dLauDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3535.28,INR,3535.28,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dLauDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-dLauDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Routledge

Three sets of keywords—gender and sexuality, whiteness and Blackness, nationality and globalization—illuminate modern dance histories from multiple angles, coming together in varied combinations, shifting positions from foreground to background. Among the many artists discussed are Isadora Duncan, Vaslav Nijinsky, Ted Shawn, Helen Tamiris, Katherine Dunham, José Limón, Pina Bausch, Reggie Wilson, and Nelisiwe Xaba. Calling for a comparative and transnational historiography, Manning ends with an extended case study of Mary Wigman’s multidimensional exchange with artists from Indonesia, India, China, Korea, and Japan. Like the artists at the center of her research, Manning’s writing dances on the fault lines of history. Her introduction and annotations to the essays reflect on how and why these keywords became central to her research, revealing the autobiographical resonances of her scholarship as she confronts the cultural politics of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780472904846'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0472904841'}]",True,True,347,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1wg4EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1wg4EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2025,University of Michigan Press

In dance classes, nightclubs, family celebrations, tourist performances, on television, film, music video and the internet, cultural memories are shared and transformed by dancing bodies adapting yesterday’s steps to today’s concerns. The book gathers emerging and seasoned scholarly voices from a wide range of geographical and disciplinary perspectives to discuss cultural remembering and forgetting in diverse popular dance contexts. The contributors ask: how are Afro-diasporic memories invoked in popular dance classes? How are popular dance genealogies manipulated and reclaimed? What is at stake for the nation in the nationalizing of folk and popular dances? And how does mediated dancing transmit memory as feelings or affects? The book reveals popular dance to be vital to cultural processes of remembering and forgetting, allowing participants to pivot between alternative pasts, presents and futures.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783030710835'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3030710831'}]",True,True,313,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rYNSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rYNSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,8401.6,INR,8401.6,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rYNSEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rYNSEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Springer Nature

Until, that is, Madame Mao's cultural delegates came in search of young peasants to study ballet at the academy in Beijing and he was thrust into a completely unfamiliar world. When a trip to Texas as part of a rare cultural exchange opened his eyes to life and love beyond China's borders, he defected to the United States in an extraordinary and dramatic tale of Cold War intrigue. Told in his own distinctive voice, this is Li's inspirational story of how he came to be Mao's last dancer, and one of the world's greatest ballet dancers.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780141918907'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '014191890X'}]",True,False,537,Biography & Autobiography,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HW5nbKZxNo4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HW5nbKZxNo4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",1,5.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,618.61,INR,309.3,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HW5nbKZxNo4C&rdid=book-HW5nbKZxNo4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2009,Penguin UK

After a wide-ranging introductory chapter on the origins of dancing, the book takes the reader through the centuries, discussing in turn the Basse Danse and the Moresco of the Middle Ages, the Pavane, Galliard and Courante of the 16th Century, the Minuet of the 17th & 18th, the Allemande, the Waltz and the Polka as well as Jazz, the Cha Cha Cha, the Jive and Twist.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000394863'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000394867'}]",False,True,296,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tSpHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tSpHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3786.62,INR,3786.62,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tSpHEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-tSpHEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Routledge

UYHSEAAAQBAJ,dance,Dance and Gender,An Evidence-Based Approach,"Wendy Oliver, Doug Risner","Driven by exacting methods and hard data, this volume reveals gender dynamics within the dance world in the twenty-first century. It provides concrete evidence about how gender impacts the daily lives of dancers, choreographers, directors, educators, and students through surveys, interviews, analyses of data from institutional sources, and action research studies. Dancers, dance artists, and dance scholars from the United States, Australia, and Canada discuss equity in three areas: concert dance, the studio, and higher education. The chapters provide evidence of bias, stereotyping, and other behaviors that are often invisible to those involved, as well as to audiences. The contributors answer incisive questions about the role of gender in various aspects of the field, including physical expression and body image, classroom experiences and pedagogy, and performance and funding opportunities. The findings reveal how inequitable practices combined with societal pressures can create environments that hinder health, happiness, and success. At the same time, they highlight the individuals working to eliminate discrimination and open up new possibilities for expression and achievement in studios, choreography, performance venues, and institutions of higher education. The dance community can strive to eliminate discrimination, but first it must understand the status quo for gender in the dance world. Wendy Oliver, professor of dance at Providence College, is coeditor of Jazz Dance: A History of the Roots and Branches. Doug Risner, professor of dance at Wayne State University, is coeditor of Hybrid Lives of Teaching Artists in Dance and Theatre Arts: A Critical Reader.

It presents various dance forms from Australia, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the South Pacific. Drawing on extensive research and decades of performative experience as artists, choreographers, producers, teachers, and critics, the authors approach issues of dance and cultural diversity from a theoretical perspective while at the same time exploring change, process, and transformation through dance. The book discusses themes such as tradition, contemporization, interdisciplinarity, dance education, youth dance, dance networks, curatorial practices, and evolving performative practices of dance companies and independents. It also looks at regional networking, curating dance festivals and spaces that foster collaboration, regional cooperation, and cultural exchange, which are essential features of dance in Asia and the Pacific. This collection will be of interest to students and researchers of pedagogy, choreography, community dance practice, theatre and performance studies, social and cultural studies, aesthetics, interdisciplinary arts, and more. It will be an invaluable resource for artists and practitioners working in dance schools and communities.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000440218'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000440214'}]",True,True,264,Art,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0ng5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0ng5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,5428.0,INR,5428.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ng5EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0ng5EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Taylor & Francis

Dance often captures those essential dimensions of social life that cannot be easily put into words. What are the flows and movements of dance carried by migrants and tourists? How is dance used to shape nationalist ideology? What are the connections between dance and ethnicity, gender, health, globalization and nationalism, capitalism and post-colonialism?

aeM_AQAAQBAJ,dance,That Deadman Dance,No Subtitle,Kim Scott,"Throughout Bobby Wabalanginy's young life the ships have been arriving, bringing European settlers to the south coast of Western Australia, where Bobby's people, the Noongar people, have always lived. Bobby, smart, resourceful and eager to please, has befriended the settlers, joining them as they hunt whales, till the land, and work to establish their new colony. He is welcomed into a prosperous white family and eventually finds himself falling in love with the daughter, Christine.But slowly - by design and by hazard - things begin to change. Not everyone is so pleased with the progress of the white colonists. Livestock mysteriously starts to disappear, crops are destroyed, there are 'accidents' and injuries on both sides. As the Europeans impose ever-stricter rules and regulations in order to keep the peace, Bobby's Elders decide they must respond in kind, and Bobby is forced to take sides, inexorably drawn into a series of events that will for ever change the future of his country.That Deadman Dance is haunted by tragedy, as most stories of first contact between European and native peoples are. But through Bobby's life, this novel exuberantly explores a moment in time when things might have been different, when black and white lived together in amazement rather than fear of the other, and when the world suddenly seemed twice as large and twice as promising.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781408829288'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1408829282'}]",False,True,417,Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aeM_AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aeM_AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2012,A&C Black

8Ykpao-TL-AC,dance,Timepass,The Memoirs of Protima Bedi,Protima Bedi,"Few lives have been more eventful and controversial than Protima Bedi's, and Timepass, derived from her unfinished autobiography, journals and her letters to family, friends and lovers, is a startlingly frank and passionate memoir. Protima recounts with unflinching honesty the events that shaped her life: her humiliation as a child at being branded the ugly duckling, repeated rape by a cousin when she was barely ten, the failure of her 'open' marriage with Kabir Bedi, her many sexual encounters, and the romantic relationships she had with prominent politicians and artistes. She writes, too, of her intense involvement with dance, her relationship with her guru and fellow dancers, the difficult mission of establishing Nrityagram, and the suicide of her son--a tragedy from which she never fully recovered. In a moving epilogue to the book, her daughter, Pooja Bedi, describes her last days and the circumstances of her death. Illustrated with over fifty photographs, Timepass is the story of a remarkable woman who had the spirit, the courage and the intelligence to live life entirely on her own terms. I have broken every single rule that our society has so carefully constructed. doing and never given a damn. I have flaunted my youth, my sex, my intelligence, and I have done it shamelessly.

x4LSEAAAQBAJ,dance,Rooted Jazz Dance,Africanist Aesthetics and Equity in the Twenty-First Century,"Lindsay Guarino, Carlos R.A. Jones, Wendy Oliver","National Dance Education Organization Ruth Lovell Murray Book Award UNCG | Susan W. Stinson Book Award for Dance Education An African American art form, jazz dance has an inaccurate historical narrative that often sets Euro-American aesthetics and values at the inception of the jazz dance genealogy. The roots were systemically erased and remain widely marginalized and untaught, and the devaluation of its Africanist origins and lineage has largely gone unchallenged. Decolonizing contemporary jazz dance practice, this book examines the state of jazz dance theory, pedagogy, and choreography in the twenty-first century, recovering and affirming the lifeblood of jazz in Africanist aesthetics and Black American culture. Rooted Jazz Dance brings together jazz dance scholars, practitioners, choreographers, and educators from across the United States and Canada with the goal of changing the course of practice in future generations. Contributors delve into the Africanist elements within jazz dance and discuss the role of Whiteness, including Eurocentric technique and ideology, in marginalizing African American vernacular dance, which has resulted in the prominence of Eurocentric jazz styles and the systemic erosion of the roots. These chapters offer strategies for teaching rooted jazz dance, examples for changing dance curricula, and artist perspectives on choreographing and performing jazz. Above all, they emphasize the importance of centering Africanist and African American principles, aesthetics, and values. Arguing that the history of jazz dance is closely tied to the history of racism in the United States, these essays challenge a century of misappropriation and lean into difficult conversations of reparations for jazz dance. This volume overcomes a major roadblock to racial justice in the dance field by amplifying the people and culture responsible for the jazz language.

amUoDwAAQBAJ,dance,Gaelic Cape Breton Step-Dancing,An Historical and Ethnographic Perspective,John G. Gibson,"The step-dancing of the Scotch Gaels in Nova Scotia is the last living example of a form of dance that waned following the great emigrations to Canada that ended in 1845. The Scotch Gael has been reported as loving dance, but step-dancing in Scotland had all but disappeared by 1945. One must look to Gaelic Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and Antigonish County, to find this tradition. Gaelic Cape Breton Step-Dancing, the first study of its kind, gives this art form and the people and culture associated with it the prominence they have long deserved. Gaelic Scotland’s cultural record is by and large pre-literate, and references to dance have had to be sought in Gaelic songs, many of which were transcribed on paper by those who knew their culture might be lost with the decline of their language. The improved Scottish culture depended proudly on the teaching of dancing and the literate learning and transmission of music in accompaniment. Relying on fieldwork in Nova Scotia, and on mentions of dance in Gaelic song and verse in Scotland and Nova Scotia, John Gibson traces the historical roots of step-dancing, particularly the older forms of dancing originating in the Gaelic–speaking Scottish Highlands. He also places the current tradition as a development and part of the much larger British and European percussive dance tradition. With insight collected through written sources, tales, songs, manuscripts, book references, interviews, and conversations, Gaelic Cape Breton Step-Dancing brings an important aspect of Gaelic history to the forefront of cultural debate.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780773550612'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0773550615'}]",True,True,316,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=amUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=amUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,4571.28,INR,4571.28,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=amUoDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-amUoDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2017,McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP

Ever’s father is injured at the hands of corrupt police on the border when he goes to visit family in Mexico, while his mother struggles both to keep her job and care for her husband. And young Ever is lost and angry at all that he doesn’t understand, at this world that seems to undermine his sense of safety. Ever’s relatives all have ideas about who he is and who he should be. His Cherokee grandmother, knowing the importance of proximity, urges the family to move across Oklahoma to be near her, while his grandfather, watching their traditions slip away, tries to reunite Ever with his heritage through traditional gourd dances. Through it all, every relative wants the same: to remind Ever of the rich and supportive communities that surround him, there to hold him tight, and for Ever to learn to take the strength given to him to save not only himself but also the next generation. How will this young man visualize a place for himself when the world hasn’t made room for him to start with?

In the early eighteenth century they moved to south-central Alabama and eventually migrated to present-day Louisiana, Texas, or Oklahoma. Today their language survives in southwestern Louisiana, where it is still spoken by the majority of tribal members living there. Published three years after Kimball?s richly detailed Koasati Grammar, this dictionary is the second of three monographs to result from his fifteen-year study of the language.

In addition to the English translations, entries in the Koasati-English section include sample sentences that illustrated word usage as well as illuminate traditional Koasati culture.

Bringing together a spectrum of voices and sensibilities in each of its four sections — Histories, Close-ups, Interfaces, and Reflections — it casts its gaze back across the past sixty years or so to recall, analyse, and assess the recent legacy of theatre and performance on this island. While offering information, overviews and reflections of current thought across its chapters, this book will serve most handily as food for thought and a springboard for curiosity.

aAcfDAAAQBAJ,dance,Preserving Dance Across Time and Space,No Subtitle,"Lynn Matluck Brooks, Joellen A. Meglin","Dance is the art least susceptible to preservation since its embodied, kinaesthetic nature has proven difficult to capture in notation and even in still or moving images. However, frameworks have been established and guidance made available for keeping dances, performances, and choreographers’ legacies alive so that the dancers of today and tomorrow can experience and learn from the dances and dancers of the past. In this volume, a range of voices address the issue of dance preservation through memory, artistic choice, interpretation, imagery and notation, as well as looking at relevant archives, legal structures, documentation and artefacts. The intertwining of dance preservation and creativity is a core theme discussed throughout this text, pointing to the essential continuity of dance history and dance innovation. The demands of preservation stretch across time, geographies, institutions and interpersonal connections, and this book focuses on the fascinating web that supports the fragile yet urgent effort to sustain our dancing heritage.

This book brings together perspectives from site dance, phenomenology, and new materialism to explore and develop how ‘site-based body practice’ can be employed to explore synergies between material bodies and material sites. Employing practice-as-research strategies, scores, tasks and exercises the book presents a number of suggestions for engaging with sites through the moving body and offers critical reflection on the potential enmeshments and entanglements that emerge as a result. The theoretical discussions and practical explorations presented will appeal to researchers, movement practitioners, artists, academics and individuals interested in exploring their lived environments through the moving body and the entangled human-nonhuman relations that emerge as a result.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783030648008'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3030648001'}]",True,True,285,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SE0aEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SE0aEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,8401.6,INR,8401.6,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SE0aEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-SE0aEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Springer Nature

When the patriarch of the Ballenger empire dies, his son, Jase, becomes its new leader. Even nearby kingdoms bow to the strength of this outlaw family, who have always governed by their own rules. But a new era looms on the horizon, set in motion by a young queen, which makes her the target of the dynasty's resentment and anger. At the same time, Kazi, a legendary former street thief, is sent by the queen to investigate transgressions against the new settlements. When Kazi arrives in the forbidding land of the Ballengers, she learns that there is more to Jase than she thought.

Based on five years of ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, choreography, and participation-observation with 40 amateur and professional K-pop dancers in New York, California, and Seoul, the book traces the evolution of K-pop dance from the 1980s to the 2020s and explains its distinctive feature called ‘gestural point choreography’ – front-driven, two-dimensional, decorative and charming movements of the upper body and face – as an example of what the author theorizes as ‘social media dance.’ It also explores K-pop cover dance as a form of intercultural performance, suggesting that, by imitating and idolizing K-pop dance, fans are eventually ‘fandoming’ themselves and their bodies. Presenting an ethnographic study of K-pop dance and its fandom, this book will be a valuable resource for students and scholars of Media Studies, Korean Studies, Performance Studies, and Dance.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000642568'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000642569'}]",True,True,260,Social Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xphxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xphxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",1,5.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,4707.02,INR,4707.02,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xphxEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-xphxEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022,Taylor & Francis

It locates these features both historically—within dance in particular social and cultural contexts—and in relation to other academic influences that have impinged on dance studies as a discipline. The editors use a thematically based approach that emphasizes that dance scholarship does not stand alone as a single entity, but is inevitably linked to other related fields, debates, and concerns. Authors from across continents have contributed chapters based on theoretical, methodological, ethnographic, and practice-based case studies, bringing together a wealth of expertise and insight to offer a study that is in-depth and wide-ranging. Ideal for scholars and upper-level students of dance and performance studies, The Routledge Companion to Dance Studies challenges the reader to expand their knowledge of this vibrant, exciting interdisciplinary field.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781315306537'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1315306530'}]",True,True,741,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mnm6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mnm6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,4819.12,INR,4819.12,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mnm6DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mnm6DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Routledge

PaIyEAAAQBAJ,dance,Dance and Activism,A Century of Radical Dance Across the World,Dana Mills,"This study focuses on dance as an activist practice in and of itself, across geographical locations and over the course of a century, from 1920 to 2020. Through doing so, it considers how dance has been an empowering agent for political action throughout civilisation. Dance and Activism offers a glimpse of different strategies of mobilizing the human body for good and justice for all, and captures the increasing political activism epitomized by bodies moving on the streets in some of the most turbulent political situations. This has, most recently, undoubtedly been partly owing to the rise of the far-right internationally, which has marked an increase in direct action on the streets. Offering a survey of key events across the century, such as the fall of President Zuma in South Africa; pro-reproductive rights action in Poland and Argentina; and the recent women's marches against Donald Trump's presidency, you will see how dance has become an urgent field of study. Key geographical locations are explored as sites of radical dance - the Lower East Side of New York; Gaza; Syria; Cairo, Iran; Iraq; Johannesburg - to name but a few - and get insights into some of the major figures in the history of dance, including Pearl Primus, Martha Graham, Anna Sokolow and Ahmad Joudah. Crucially, lesser or unknown dancers, who have in some way influenced politics, all over the world are brought into the limelight (the Syrian ballerinas and Hussein Smko, for example). Dance and Activism troubles the boundary between theory and practice, while presenting concrete case studies as a site for robust theoretical analysis.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781350137011'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1350137014'}]",False,False,217,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PaIyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PaIyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2021,Bloomsbury Publishing
2bfyngEACAAJ,dance,Dance,A Very Social History,"Carol McD. Wallace, Don McDonagh, Jean L. Druesedow, Laurence Libin, Constance Old","The Ball nights in Bath are moments snatched from Paradise, rendered bewitching by music, beauty, elegance, fashion, etiquette. . . . Thus did Charles Dickens in Pickwick Papers describe the magic of a grand ball. Even the names of such dances as the minuet, the quadrille, and the waltz are enough to evoke the image of a resplendently dressed assemblage performing with grace and style. The anticipation that precedes such a great social occasion and the afterglow of recollection are intensified not just by the dance and the music but also by the costumes that are so integral a part of the experience. Dance offers a feast for the eye as well as the ear, for it is in response to the grand ball that costume artists have produced some of their most inspired designs. The collections of The Costume Institute of The Metropolitan Museum of Art are especially rich in clothing made expressly for dancing, from the formal gowns of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the mini-dresses of the twentieth. This book was published on the occasion of an exhibition held at the Metropolitan Museum from December 17, 1987 through September 6, 1987.

NI_hEAAAQBAJ,dance,Ethical Agility in Dance,Rethinking Technique in British Contemporary Dance,"Noyale Colin, Catherine Seago, Kathryn Stamp","This edited collection examines the potential of dance training for developing socially engaged individuals capable of forging ethical human relations for an ever-changing world and in turn frames dance as a fundamental part of human experience. This volume draws together a range of critical voices to reflect the inclusive potential of dance. The contributions offer perspectives on contemporary dance training in Britain from dance educators, scholars, practitioners and artists. Through examining the politics, values and ethics of learning dance today, this book argues for the need of a re-assessment of the evolving practices in dance training and techniques. Key questions address how the concept of ‘technique’ and associated systems of training in dance could be redefined to enable the collaboration of skills and application of ideas necessary to twenty-first-century dance. The editors present these ideas in different modes of writing. This collection of essays, conversations and manifestos offers a way to explore, debate and grasp the shifting values of contemporary dance. Examining these values in the applied field of dance reveals a complex and contrasting range of ideas, encompassing broad themes including the relationships between individuality and collectivity, rigour and creativity, and virtuosity and inclusivity. This volume points to ethical techniques as providing a way of navigating these contrasting values in dance. It serves as an invaluable resource for academics as well as practitioners and students.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000983791'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '100098379X'}]",True,True,347,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NI_hEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NI_hEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,5428.0,INR,5428.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NI_hEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NI_hEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2023,Taylor & Francis

Dance is human thought and feeling expressed through the body: it is at once organized physical movement, language, and a system of rules appropriate in different social situations. Hanna offers a theory of dance, drawing on work in anthropology, semiotics, sociology, communications, folklore, political science, religion, and psychology as well as the visual and performing arts.

With his blend of many years of medical practice and personal pilgrimage, combining Biblical wisdom with contemporary relevance, Sunil Raheja's reflections help us to probe our fundamental priorities and values. This book encourages us to face the why questions about the biggest and inescapable issues of our existence, of life and death, meaning and purpose. But it also charts an attractive path to a life of greater enjoyment, fulfilment and potential flourishing, which might just change everything. It is well worth examining. I warmly commend it."" David Jackman, Past President of the Proclamation Trust, London Never before have we had access to such stunning technological advances or timesaving tools--yet we are still exhausted, overwhelmed, frustrated and empty. STOP GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE. Thoreau described most people as living in ""quiet desperation"" and dying with ""their song still inside them."" When we are young, we dream about how we will change the world and the positive impact we will make. At mid-life, we are bruised by disappointment, dashed dreams, and even the death of loved ones. The world encourages us to ignore the pain and anaesthetise our frustrations and disappointments with mindless entertainment, cynicism and victimhood. Such a mindset for many people creates an unprecedented and alarming rise in mental illness, discontent, and unhappiness. THERE IS A BETTER WAY....to connect with the timeless truths of wisdom: Become fully alive in body, mind and spirit--embrace and enjoy life.

teakBwAAQBAJ,dance,Spinning Mambo into Salsa,Caribbean Dance in Global Commerce,Juliet McMains,"Arguably the world's most popular partnered social dance form, salsa's significance extends well beyond the Latino communities which gave birth to it. The growing international and cross-cultural appeal of this Latin dance form, which celebrates its mixed origins in the Caribbean and in Spanish Harlem, offers a rich site for examining issues of cultural hybridity and commodification in the context of global migration. Salsa consists of countless dance dialects enjoyed by varied communities in different locales. In short, there is not one dance called salsa, but many. Spinning Mambo into Salsa, a history of salsa dance, focuses on its evolution in three major hubs for international commercial export-New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. The book examines how commercialized salsa dance in the 1990s departed from earlier practices of Latin dance, especially 1950s mambo. Topics covered include generational differences between Palladium Era mambo and modern salsa; mid-century antecedents to modern salsa in Cuba and Puerto Rico; tension between salsa as commercial vs. cultural practice; regional differences in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami; the role of the Web in salsa commerce; and adaptations of social Latin dance for stage performance. Throughout the book, salsa dance history is linked to histories of salsa music, exposing how increased separation of the dance from its musical inspiration has precipitated major shifts in Latin dance practice. As a whole, the book dispels the belief that one version is more authentic than another by showing how competing styles came into existence and contention. Based on over 100 oral history interviews, archival research, ethnographic participant observation, and analysis of Web content and commerce, the book is rich with quotes from practitioners and detailed movement description.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780199324651'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0199324654'}]",False,True,425,Music,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=teakBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=teakBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,868.33,INR,434.16,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=teakBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-teakBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2015,Oxford University Press

YU0bAAAAMAAJ,dance,Shakespeare and the Dance,No Subtitle,Alan Brissenden,"Dancing was an essential part of life in Shakespeare's England. Town and country folk danced at weddings, Maydays and other festivities. Queen Elizabeth prided herself on her skill (and danced galliards in the morning to keep fit), and dancing was the soul of the extravagant masques which so delighted King James. Puritans might furiously denounce it but it was part of the ceremonial of the Inns of Court and a necessary accomplishment for a gentleman. At the same time, as Alan Brissenden shows in this book, the dance was an accepted symbol of harmony, and it was in this way that Shakespeare used it to express one of his major themes: the attempt to achieve order in a discordant world. He included it in at least a dozen of his plays and referred to it in thirty. A valuable source for his imagery, it also illuminates character and action and in some plays helps to forward the plot. In the history plays allusions to country dance, (especially the morris, and court dances like the lavolta) support ideas of conflict and the presentation of characters, especially Henry V. While there is no dancing itself in the histories there is plenty to be found in the comedies and two chapters of the book closely examine the relation of dance to dialogue, character and plot, particularly in ""Love's Labour's Lost"", ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing"". In the tragedies dancing becomes a powerful ironic visual symbol, especially in Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and Timon of Athens. After 1607 dance occurs in almost all of Shakespeare's plays, in such a way that it reflects and expresses the fusion of tragic and comic elements which characterize most of them. The closing chapters show how the dance relates to the cosmic ideas and imagery of these last plays from Perides to Henry VIII and suggest certain influences from the spectacular court masques of the time. In presenting his argument the author, who is a dance critic as well as an Elizabethan scholar, has drawn on manuscript sources, a wide range of contemporary writing, including dance manuals, and his own ideas in dance and theatre. This is a book for students and scholars, for editors, for theatre directors and for those interested in Renaissance dance. It is a book for everyone who delights in the riches of Shakespeare and the age in which he lived. -- Book cover.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'UOM:39015006245180'}]",False,False,180,Drama,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YU0bAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YU0bAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,1981,"Atlantic Highlands, N.J. : Humanities Press"

_t7ZzQEACAAJ,dance,Dancing with the Revolution,"Power, Politics, and Privilege in Cuba",Elizabeth B. Schwall,"Elizabeth B. Schwall aligns culture and politics by focusing on an art form that became a darling of the Cuban revolution: dance. In this history of staged performance in ballet, modern dance, and folkloric dance, Schwall analyzes how and why dance artists interacted with republican and, later, revolutionary politics. Drawing on written and visual archives, including intriguing exchanges between dancers and bureaucrats, Schwall argues that Cubans dancers used their bodies and ephemeral, nonverbal choreography to support and critique political regimes and cultural biases. As esteemed artists, Cuban dancers exercised considerable power and influence. They often used their art to posit more radical notions of social justice than political leaders were able or willing to implement. After 1959, while generally promoting revolutionary projects like mass education and internationalist solidarity, they also took risks by challenging racial prejudice, gender norms, and censorship, all of which could affect dancers personally. On a broader level, Schwall shows that dance, too often overlooked in histories of Latin America and the Caribbean, provides fresh perspectives on what it means for people, and nations, to move through the world.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1469662965'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781469662961'}]",False,False,320,Uncategorized,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_t7ZzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_t7ZzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2021,Unknown Publisher

fwHsEAAAQBAJ,dance,The Impact of Touch in Dance Movement Psychotherapy,A Body-Mind Centering Approach,Katy Dymoke,"This book explores the therapeutic use of touch, focusing on an in-depth case study of work in an NHS setting with a client with learning disabilities, and situating this within a wide theoretical context. This is a unique and influential study illustrating the impact of touch in dance movement psychotherapy and laying the ground for a theory on the use of touch in Dance Movement Psychotherapy (DMP). The case study illustrates the impact of touch upon the therapeutic relationship with the use of video transcription and descriptive reflexive accounts of the session content. The case analysis sections establish the ground for a paradigm shift, and for emergent theory and methods in support of the use of touch in Dance Movement Psychotherapy and other contexts. The role touch takes is beyond its affect, which expands our understanding of its potency as an intervention. The writing is embedded in many years of practice-led-research in the field of dance and somatic practices, in particular Body-Mind Centering® and Contact Improvisation, in which touching and being touched is met with curiosity as a place of insight and revelation, beyond the bounds of taboo and social diktat. The study considers the philosophical landscape of both touch and non-touch. This book explores and reflects upon the use of touch, considering the wider context and socially imposed perceptions that would prevent touch from taking place – including philosophical and social discourses. Through telling the story of a client case, the book offers a wealth of thought-provoking content to inspire continued dialogue. Key strengths of this book are the depth, warmth and perceptiveness of the case history, and the way in which this is successfully linked with theory. Particular attention is paid to embodied cognition and exosystemic theory, the two leading developments of current thinking. With the ethical, practical and philosophical content, the book will be of interest to psychotherapists, health and social care practitioners, as well as arts in health practitioners and beneficiaries in educational programs and settings. Primary readership will be among DMP psychotherapists, body psychotherapists, drama therapists, Body Mind Centering® practitioners, arts in health practitioners, people working with clients with learning disabilities and any practitioner and researcher interested in understanding the role touch may play in the psychotherapeutic encounter.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781789384581'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1789384583'}]",False,True,308,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fwHsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fwHsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2021,Intellect Books

Roger Copeland and Deborah Jowitt each take a controversial look at the modern American dance. Kenneth Archer and Millicent Hodson explain the processes they use when reconstructing 'lost' ballets, and Theresa Buckland and Georgina Gore write on traditional dance in England and West Africa respectively. With other contributions on social dance, ballet, early European modern dance and feminist perspectives on dance history this book offers a multitude of starting points for studying dance history as well as presenting examples of dance writing at its very best.

Teller eagerly collected such personal gems, among them toys, a porcelain figurine and bridges made in the family's violin workshop; the resulting images by Araki are haunting yet playful, creating an intriguing narrative alongside the original story.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3958297455'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783958297456'}]",False,False,72,Uncategorized,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lR15zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lR15zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,Steidl

Focusing on ADT's creative processes and organizational strategies, the book highlights how women and femme artists of color, working with a marginalized movement aesthetic, claim and transform the spaces of contemporary concert dance into sites of empowerment, resistance, and knowledge production. Blending essays with epistolary texts, interviews and poems, the collection's contributors offer up a multigenre exploration of how dance and other artistic undertakings can be intersectionally reimagined. Building on more than fifteen years of collaborative dance-making and sustained dialogues, Dancing Transnational Feminisms delves into timely questions surrounding race and performance, art and politics, global and local inequities and the responsibilities of artists towards the communities they come from""--","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0295749555'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780295749556'}]",False,False,296,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ekVazgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ekVazgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2021,Decolonizing Feminisms

1x3WnQAACAAJ,dance,The Devils' Dance,No Subtitle,Hamid Ismailov,"Winner of the EBRD Literature Prize 2019 On New Years' Eve 1938, the writer Abdulla Qodiriy is taken from his home by the Soviet secret police and thrown into a Tashkent prison. There, to distract himself from the physical and psychological torment of beatings and mindless interrogations, he attempts to mentally reconstruct the novel he was writing at the time of his arrest - based on the tragic life of the Uzbek poet-queen Oyhon, married to three khans in succession, and living as Abdulla now does, with the threat of execution hanging over her. As he gets to know his cellmates, Abdulla discovers that the Great Game of Oyhon's time, when English and Russian spies infiltrated the courts of Central Asia, has echoes in the 1930s present, but as his identification with his protagonist increases and past and present overlap it seems that Abdulla's inability to tell fact from fiction will be his undoing. The Devils' Dance brings to life the extraordinary culture of 19th century Turkestan, a world of lavish poetry recitals, brutal polo matches, and a cosmopolitan and culturally diverse Islam rarely described in western literature. Hamid Ismailov's virtuosic prose recreates this multilingual milieu in a digressive, intricately structured novel, dense with allusion, studded with quotes and sayings, and threaded through with modern and classical poetry. With this poignant, loving resurrection of both a culture and a literary canon brutally suppressed by a dictatorship which continues today, Ismailov demonstrates yet again his masterful marriage of contemporary international fiction and the Central Asian literary traditions, and his deserved position in the pantheon of both.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1911284134'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781911284130'}]",False,False,0,"Asia, Central",en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1x3WnQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1x3WnQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2018,Inpress Books - Ipsuk

INclwI7valcC,dance,The Dance of Death in the Middle Ages,"Image, Text, Performance",Elina Gertsman,"Elina Gertsman's multifaceted study introduces readers to the imagery and texts of the Dance of Death, an extraordinary subject that first emerged in western European art and literature in the late medieval era. Conceived from the start as an inherently public image, simultaneously intensely personal and widely accessible, the medieval Dance of Death proclaimed the inevitability of death and declared the futility of human ambition. Gertsman inquires into the theological, socio-historic, literary, and artistic contexts of the Dance of Death, exploring it as a site of interaction between text, image, and beholder. Pulling together a wide variety of sources and drawing attention to those images that have slipped through the cracks of the art historical canon, Gertsman examines the visual, textual, aural, pastoral, and performative discourses that informed the creation and reception of the Dance of Death, and proposes different modes of viewing for several paintings, each of which invited the beholder to participate in an active, kinesthetic experience.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'UCSD:31822038709457'}]",False,False,384,Art,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=INclwI7valcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=INclwI7valcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2010,Brepols Publishers

IJKMEAAAQBAJ,dance,When the Elephants Dance,No Subtitle,Tess Uriza Holthe,"“Papa explains the war like this: ‘When the elephants dance, the chickens must be careful.’ The great beasts, as they circle one another, shaking the trees and trumpeting loudly, are the Amerikanos and the Japanese as they fight. And our Philippine Islands? We are the small chickens.” Once in a great while comes a storyteller who can illuminate worlds large and small, magical and true to life. When the Elephants Dance introduces us to the incandescent voice of Tess Uriza Holthe, who sets her remarkable first novel in the waning days of World War II, as the Japanese and the Americans engage in a fierce battle for possession of the Philippine Islands. The Karangalan family and their neighbors huddle for survival in the cellar of a house a few miles from Manila. Outside the safety of their little refuge the war rages on—fiery bombs torch the beautiful Filipino countryside, Japanese soldiers round up and interrogate innocent people, and from the hills guerillas wage a desperate campaign against the enemy. Inside the cellar, these men, women, and children put their hopes and dreams on hold as they wait out the war, only emerging to look for food, water, and medicine. Through the eyes of three narrators, thirteen-year-old Alejandro Karangalan, his spirited older sister Isabelle, and Domingo, a passionate guerilla commander, we see how ordinary people must learn to live in the midst of extraordinary uncertainty, how they must find hope for survival where none seems to exist. They find this hope in the dramatic history of the Philippine Islands and the passion and bravery of its people. Crowded together in the cellar, the Karangalans and their friends and neighbors tell magical stories to one another based on Filipino myth and legend to fuel their courage, pass the time, and teach important lessons. The group is held spellbound by these stories, which feature a dazzling array of ghosts, witches, supernatural creatures, and courageous Filipinos who changed the course of history with their actions. These profoundly moving stories transport the listeners from the chaos of the war around them and give them new resolve to fight on. With When the Elephants Dance Holthe has not only written a gripping narrative of how Alejandro, Isabelle, Domingo and their community fight for survival, but a loving tribute to the magical realism that infuses Filipino culture. The stories shared by her characters are based on the same tales handed down to Holthe from her Filipino father and lola, her grandmother. This stunning debut novel is the first to celebrate in such richness and depth the spirit of the Filipino people and their fascinating story and marks the introduction of a talented new author who will join the ranks of writers such as Arundhati Roy, Manil Suri, and Amy Tan.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780142002889'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0142002887'}]",True,False,0,Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IJKMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IJKMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2003,National Geographic Books

Using the Brazilian city of Salvador da Bahia as its focal point, this volume brings to the fore questions of citizenship, human rights, and community building.

DeOOm6lyG_UC,dance,Choreographing Difference,The Body and Identity in Contemporary Dance,Ann Cooper Albright,"The choreographies of Bill T. Jones, Cleveland Ballet Dancing Wheels, Zab Maboungou, David Dorfman, Marie Chouinard, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, and others, have helped establish dance as a crucial discourse of the 90s. These dancers, Ann Cooper Albright argues, are asking the audience to see the body as a source of cultural identity — a physical presence that moves with and through its gendered, racial, and social meanings. Through her articulate and nuanced analysis of contemporary choreography, Albright shows how the dancing body shifts conventions of representation and provides a critical example of the dialectical relationship between cultures and the bodies that inhabit them. As a dancer, feminist, and philosopher, Albright turns to the material experience of bodies, not just the body as a figure or metaphor, to understand how cultural representation becomes embedded in the body. In arguing for the intelligence of bodies, Choreographing Difference is itself a testimonial, giving voice to some important political, moral, and artistic questions of our time.

04HSEAAAQBAJ,dance,La Meri and Her Life in Dance,Performing the World,Nancy Lee Chalfa Ruyter,"This intriguing biography details the life and work of world dance pioneer La Meri (1899–1988). An American dancer, choreographer, teacher, and writer, La Meri was ahead of her time in championing cross-cultural dance performances and education, yet she is almost totally forgotten today. In La Meri and Her Life in Dance, Nancy Ruyter introduces readers to a visionary artist who played a pivotal role in dance history. Born in Texas as Russell Meriwether Hughes, La Meri toured throughout Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and the United States in the 1920s and ’30s, immersing herself in different dance traditions at a time when few American dancers explored styles outside their own. She learned about Indian dance culture from the celebrated Uday Shankar, studied belly dancing with the Moroccan sultan’s top dancer, and took flamenco lessons in Spain. La Meri spread awareness and enjoyment of the world’s myriad forms of expression before it was common for performing artists from these countries to tour internationally. ﻿Ruyter describes how La Meri founded the Ethnologic Dance Center in New York City, choreographed innovative works based on various dance cultures for Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival and other venues, and wrote widely on the styles and techniques of international dance genres. This long-overdue book illustrates that the popularity of world dance today owes much to the trailblazing efforts of La Meri.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780813065113'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0813065119'}]",True,True,386,Biography & Autobiography,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=04HSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=04HSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2019,University Press of Florida
vr5yMMenLnoC,dance,Dance and the Nation,"Performance, Ritual, and Politics in Sri Lanka",Susan Anita Reed,"Around the globe, dances that originate in village, temple, and court rituals have been adapted and transformed to carry secular meanings and serve new national purposes. In stage performances, dance competitions, and festivals worldwide, dance has become an emblem of ethnicity and an index of national identity. But what are the ""backstage"" stories of those dances, and what have been the consequences for their communities of origin? In Dance and the Nation, Susan A. Reed brings to light the complexities of aesthetic politics in a multi-faceted exploration and analysis of the Kandyan dance of Sri Lanka. The dance, which is identified with the island's majority Sinhala ethnic group, is heavily supported by the state. Derived from the Kohomba kankariya, an elaborate village ritual performed by men of the hereditary drummer caste, the dance was adopted by the state as a symbol of traditional Sinhala culture in the postindependence period and opened to individuals of all castes. Reed's evocative account traces the history and consequences of this transition from ritual to stage, situating the dance in relation to postcolonial nationalism and ethnic politics and emphasizing the voices and perspectives of the hereditary dancers and women performers. Kandyan dance is characterized by an elegant and energetic style and lively displays of agility. The companion DVD includes unparalleled footage of this vibrant dance in ritual, stage, and training contexts, and features the most esteemed performers of the Kandyan region.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'UCSD:31822036454445'}]",False,False,308,History,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vr5yMMenLnoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vr5yMMenLnoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2010,Unknown Publisher

Lev and Svetlana, kept apart for fourteen years by the Second World War and the Gulag, stayed true to each other and exchanged thousands of secret letters as Lev battled to survive in Stalin's camps. Using this remarkable cache of smuggled correspondence, Orlando Figes tells the tale of two incredible people who, swept along in the very worst of times, kept their devotion alive. Orlando Figes was granted exclusive access to the thousands of letters between Lev and Sveta that form the foundation of Just Send Me Word, and he was able to interview the couple in person, then in their nineties. These real-time and largely uncensored letters form the largest cache of Gulag letters ever found. Reviews: 'One is overcome with admiration for the kindness, bravery and generosity of people in terrible peril ... It is impossible to read without shedding tears' Simon Sebag Montefiore, Financial Times 'This powerful narrative by a distinguished historian will take its place not just in history but in literature' Robert Massie 'Electrifying, passionate, devoted, despairing, exhilarating ... a tale of hope, resilience, grit and love' The Times 'Moving ... a remarkable discovery' Max Hastings, Sunday Times 'The gulag story lacks individuals for us to sympathise with: a Primo Levi, an Anne Frank or even an Oskar Schindler. Just Send Me Word may well be the book to change that' Oliver Bullough, Independent 'Immensely touching ... [a] heartening gem of a book' Anna Reid, Literary Review 'The remarkable true story of a love affair between two Soviet citizens ... as much a literary challenge as a historical one: the book can be read as a non-fiction novel' Telegraph 'Remarkable ... Figes, selecting and then interpreting this mass of letters, makes them tell two kinds of story. The first is a uniquely detailed narrative of the gulag, of the callous, slatternly universe which consumed millions of lives ... The second is about two people determined not to lose each other' Neal Ascherson, Guardian 'A quiet, moving and memorable account of life in a totalitarian state ... The book often reads like a novel ... captivating' Evening Standard 'Orlando Figes has wrought something beautiful from dark times' Ian Thomson, Observer 'A heart-rending record of extraordinary human endurance' Kirkus Reviews '[A] remarkable tale of love and devotion during the worst years of the USSR ... [Figes's] fine narrative pacing enhances this moving, memorable story' Publishers Weekly About the author: Orlando Figes is Professor of History at Birkbeck College, University of London.

cep8EAAAQBAJ,dance,Theory and Practice in Eighteenth-Century Dance,The German-French Connection,Tilden Russell,"This book is about the intersection of two evolving dance-historical realms—theory and practice—during the first two decades of the eighteenth century. France was the source of works on notation, choreography, and repertoire that dominated European dance practice until the 1780s. While these French inventions were welcomed and used in Germany, German dance writers responded by producing an important body of work on dance theory. This book examines consequences in Germany of this asymmetrical confrontation of dance perspectives. Between 1703 and 1717 in Germany, a coherent theory of dance was postulated that called itself dance theory, comprehended why it was a theory, and clearly, rationally distinguished itself from practice. This flowering of dance-theoretical writing was contemporaneous with the appearance of Beauchamps-Feuillet notation in the Chorégraphie of Raoul Auger Feuillet (Paris, 1700, 1701). Beauchamps-Feuillet notation was the ideal written representation of the dance style known as la belle danse and practiced in both the ballroom and the theater. Its publication enabled the spread of belle danse to the French provinces and internationally. This spread encouraged the publication of new practical works (manuals, choreographies, recueils) on how to make steps and how to dance current dances, as well as of new dance treatises, in different languages. The Rechtschaffener Tantzmeister, by Gottfried Taubert (Leipzig, 1717), includes a translated edition of Feuillet’s Chorégraphie. Theory and Practice in Eighteenth-Century Dance addresses how Taubert and his contemporary German authors of dance treatises (Samuel Rudolph Behr, Johann Pasch, Louis Bonin) became familiar with Beauchamps-Feuillet notation and acknowledged the Chorégraphie in their own work, and how Taubert’s translation of the Chorégraphie spread its influence northward and eastward in Europe. This book also examines the personal and literary interrelationships between the German writers on dance between 1703 and 1717 and their invention of a theoria of dance as a counterbalance to dance praxis, comparing their dance-theoretical ideas with those of John Weaver in England, and assimilating them all in a cohesive and inclusive description of dance theory in Europe by 1721.

E1Gwwt1sZ3EC,dance,Contact Improvisation,An Introduction to a Vitalizing Dance Form,Cheryl Pallant,"In most forms of dancing, performers carry out their steps with a distance that keeps them from colliding with each other. Dancer Steve Paxton in the 1970s considered this distance a territory for investigation. His study of intentional contact resulted in a public performance in 1972 in a Soho gallery, and the name ""contact improvisation"" was coined for the form of unrehearsed dance he introduced. Rather than copyrighting it, Paxton allowed it to evolve and spread. In this book the author draws upon her own experience and research to explain the art of contact improvisation, in which dance partners propel movement by physical contact. They roll, fall, spiral, leap, and slip along the contours and momentum of moving bodies. The text begins with a history, then describes the elements that define this form of dance. Subsequent chapters explore how contact improvisation relates to self and identity; how class, race, gender, culture and physiology influence dance; how dance promotes connection in a culture of isolation; and how it relates to the concept of community. The final chapter is a collection of exercises explained in the words of teachers from across the United States and abroad. Appendix A describes how to set up and maintain a weekly jam; Appendix B details recommended reading, videos and Web sites. Instructors considering this book for use in a course may request an examination copy here.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780786426478'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0786426470'}]",True,True,209,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E1Gwwt1sZ3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E1Gwwt1sZ3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2006,McFarland

Not only does it help to develop the prerequisite physical skills and co-ordination for writing, it also encourages creativity, self expression and confidence' - Chris Dukes, Early Years Area Senco Praise for the first edition: 'A useful resource to have in any early years setting, providing a wealth of information within a very neat and compact book' - Special 'The Write Dance materials are wonderfully done. After meeting with Ragnhild a few years ago, I have been using many of these principles in my work with children. The methods definitely work and are definitely needed by today's kids' - Delina Robair, Developmental Child Specialist, USA Write Dance is an exciting and innovative programme which uses music and movement to introduce handwriting to children. Write Dance movements are designed to help children feel happy and comfortable with their bodies, improving their motor skills and providing a strong foundation for writing. Ranghild A. Oussoren developed the approach in Holland ten years ago and it has gone on to capture the imagination of children and teachers across Europe. In this new edition of Write Dance in the Early Years, practitioners are provided with a package of songs, stories and illustrations, as well as guidance on implementing Write Dance in their early years setting. This book and audio CD introduces the nine themes of the Write Dance approach at the appropriate developmental level for the early years. The programme supports the Be Healthy, Enjoy and Achieve outcome of the Every Child Matters agenda. It also links to the following aspects within the six areas of learning in the Early Years Foundation stage: -Creative Development through imaginative play, music and dance -Physical Development through movement using equipment and materials -Communication, Language and Literacy through handwriting -Personal Social and Emotional Development through increasing self-confidence and self-esteem This programme benefits all children, but has also been found very helpful for children with special education needs, from learning difficulties to dyspraxia.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781446246849'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1446246841'}]",False,True,129,Education,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ezs8oReaGHcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ezs8oReaGHcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2010,SAGE Publications Ltd

kpc9EAAAQBAJ,dance,Scorpions' Dance,"The President, the Spymaster, and Watergate",Jefferson Morley,"For the 50th anniversary of the Watergate break-in: The untold story of President Richard Nixon, CIA Director Richard Helms, and their volatile shared secrets that ended a presidency. Scorpions' Dance by intelligence expert and investigative journalist Jefferson Morley reveals the Watergate scandal in a completely new light: as the culmination of a concealed, deadly power struggle between President Richard Nixon and CIA Director Richard Helms. Nixon and Helms went back decades; both were 1950s Cold Warriors, and both knew secrets about the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba as well as off-the-books American government and CIA plots to remove Fidel Castro and other leaders in Latin America. Both had enough information on each other to ruin their careers. After the Watergate burglary on June 17, 1972, Nixon was desperate to shut down the FBI's investigation. He sought Helms' support and asked that the CIA intervene—knowing that most of the Watergate burglars were retired CIA agents, contractors, or long-term assets with deep knowledge of the Agency's most sensitive secrets. The two now circled each other like scorpions, defending themselves with the threat of lethal attack. The loser would resign his office in disgrace; the winner, however, would face consequences for the secrets he had kept. Rigorously researched and dramatically told, Scorpions' Dance uses long-neglected evidence to reveal a new perspective on one of America's most notorious presidential scandals.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250275844'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250275849'}]",True,False,234,Political Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kpc9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kpc9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,605.97,INR,302.98,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kpc9EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kpc9EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022,St. Martin's Press

VbREDgAAQBAJ,dance,The Russian Revolution,A New History,Sean McMeekin,"At the turn of the century, the Russian economy was growing by about 10% annually and its population had reached 150 million. By 1920 the country was in desperate financial straits and more than 20 million Russians had died. And by 1950, a third of the globe had embraced communism. The triumph of Communism sets a profound puzzle. How did the Bolsheviks win power and then cling to it amid the chaos they had created? Traditional histories remain a captive to Marxist ideas about class struggle. Analysing never before used files from the Tsarist military archives, McMeekin argues that war is the answer. The revolutionaries were aided at nearly every step by Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland who sought to benefit - politically and economically - from the changes overtaking the country. To make sense of Russia's careening path the essential question is not Lenin's ""who, whom?"", but who benefits?","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781782833796'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '178283379X'}]",True,True,349,History,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VbREDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VbREDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1178.18,INR,589.09,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VbREDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-VbREDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2017,Profile Books

Best friends for more than half their lives, the two are practically inseparable. And in the summer before their last year of high school, Sam and Jules are certain that whatever the future brings - college or professional dance careers or both - they'll be ready for it, sharing the triumphs and facing the tears together. But nothing could have prepared them for Jules's sudden illness and the discovery of its cause - cancer. Sam tries to be a true friend, supporting Jules during the weeks of testing and doctors and treatments, but the horrifying pain and indignities that Jules suffers, and the feeling that she has lost control over her own life, force Jules to a place where even Sam cannot follow. Now both Jules and Sam must learn to accept the unacceptable - that Jules's cancer may not go away. How each, in her own way, comes to face the possibility of Jules's death, and learns to celebrate her life, makes for a searingly honest, unforgettable novel.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '031603634X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780316036344'}]",False,False,0,Young Adult Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fAt_PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fAt_PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2009,"Little, Brown Books for Young Readers"

This is evident from the social history of jive, the marketing of trans-national ballet, ritual healing dances in Italy or folk dances performed for tourists in Mexico, Panama and Canada. Dance often captures those essential dimensions of social life that cannot be easily put into words. What are the flows and movements of dance carried by migrants and tourists? How is dance used to shape nationalist ideology? What are the connections between dance and ethnicity, gender, health, globalization and nationalism, capitalism and post-colonialism?

I4DSEAAAQBAJ,dance,Site Dance,Choreographers and the Lure of Alternative Spaces,"Melanie Kloetzel, Carolyn Pavlik","In recent years, site-specific dance has grown in popularity. In the wake of groundbreaking work by choreographers who left traditional performance spaces for other venues, more and more performances are cropping up on skyscrapers, in alleyways, on trains, on the decks of aircraft carriers, and in a myriad of other unexpected locations worldwide. In Site Dance, the first anthology to examine site-specific dance, editors Melanie Kloetzel and Carolyn Pavlik explore the work that choreographers create for nontraditional performance spaces and the thinking behind their creative choices. Combining interviews with and essays by some of the most prominent and influential practitioners of site dance, they look at the challenges and rewards of embracing alternative spaces. The close examinations of the work of artists like Meredith Monk, Joanna Haigood, Stephan Koplowitz, Heidi Duckler, Ann Carlson, and Eiko Otake provide important insights into why choreographers leave the theatre to embrace the challenges of unconventional venues. Site Dance also includes more than 80 photographs of site-specific performances, revealing how the arts, and movement in particular, can become part of and speak to our everyday lives. Celebrating the often unexpected beauty and juxtapositions created by site dance, the book is essential reading for anyone curious about the way that these choreographers are changing our experience of the world one step at a time.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780813059006'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0813059003'}]",True,True,471,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I4DSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I4DSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2013,University Press of Florida

But when her forward-thinking father is beaten senseless by the British police, she is forced to live with her grandfather’s large traditional family, where the women live apart from the men and are meant to be married off as soon as possible. Vidya’s only refuge becomes her grandfather’s upstairs library, which is forbidden to women. There she meets Raman, a young man also living in the house who relishes her intellectual curiosity. But when Vidya’s brother makes a choice the family cannot condone, and when Raman seems to want more than friendship, Vidkya must question all she has believed in.

SQ4BqvYKj_gC,dance,Island's End,No Subtitle,Padma Venkatraman,"From the acclaimed author of Climbing the Stairs comes a fascinating story set on a remote island untouched by time. Uido is ecstatic about becoming her tribe's spiritual leader, but her new position brings her older brother's jealousy and her best friend's mistrust. And looming above these troubles are the recent visits of strangers from the mainland who have little regard for nature or the spirits, and tempt the tribe members with gifts, making them curious about modern life. When Uido's little brother falls deathly ill, she must cross the ocean and seek their help. Having now seen so many new things, will Uido have the strength to believe in herself and the old ways? And will her people trust her to lead them to safety when a catastrophic tsunami threatens?

r5fgKQn2LZ4C,dance,Dance Writings & Poetry,No Subtitle,Edwin Denby,"Edwin Denby, who died in 1983, was the most important and influential American dance critic of this century. His reviews and essays, which he wrote for almost thirty years, were possessed of a voice, vision, and passion as compelling and inspiring as his subject. He was also a poet of distinction -- a friend to Frank O'Hara, James Schuyler, and John Ashbery. This book presents a sampling of his reviews, essays, and poems, an exemplary collection that exhibits the elegance, lucidity, and timelessness of Denby's writings.The volume includes Denby's reactions to choreography ranging from Martha Graham to George Balanchine to the Rockettes, as well as his reflections on such general topics as dance in film, dance criticism, and meaning in dance. Denby's writings are presented chronologically, and they not only provide a picture of how his dance theories and reviewing methods evolved but also give an informal history of dance in New York from the late 1930s to the early 1960s. The book -- the Only collection of Denby's writings currently in print -- is an essential resource for students and lover of dance.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0300069855'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780300069853'}]",True,False,340,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5fgKQn2LZ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5fgKQn2LZ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,1998,Yale University Press

Bruce,"Dance and Dance Drama in Education attempts to explain the arts of dance and dance drama as they take place in schools and colleges, and to relate them to other, more familiar creative arts in education. It takes into account the needs of young people in so far as they relate to these arts, and sets out to some extent to observe and to estimate the balance or lack of balance in school curricula, establishing the possible place of dance and dance drama in the education of children. Special attention is given to the place of this work in the curriculum of the Secondary Modern Girls' School, where such arts could play a most important part. The book begins by tracing the history of dance leading to the present place of dance and dance drama in education. This is followed by separate chapters on the language of movement; aims of the teacher of dance and dance drama; the link between the arts of dance and dance drama; and dance and dance drama as therapy. Subsequent chapters deal with movement, dance, and dance drama in primary and secondary schools; and work with students in a teacher training college.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781483158518'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1483158519'}]",False,True,143,Games & Activities,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=onaoBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=onaoBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2297.46,INR,2297.46,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=onaoBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-onaoBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2014,Elsevier
zdEhEAAAQBAJ,dance,"Dance, Architecture and Engineering",In Conversation,Adesola Akinleye,"This book was born from a year of exchanges of movement ideas generated in cross-practice conversations and workshops with dancers, musicians, architects and engineers. Events took place at key cultural institutions such as the Royal Academy of Arts, London; and The Lowry, Salford, as well as on-site at architectural firms and on the streets of London. The author engages with dance's offer of perspectives on being in place: how the 'ordinary person' is facilitated in experiencing the dance of the city, while also looking at shared cross-practice understandings in and about the body, weight and rhythm. There is a prioritizing of how embodied knowledges across dance, architecture and engineering can contribute to decolonizing the production of place – in particular, how dance and city-making cultures engage with female bodies and non-white bodies in today's era of #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. Akinleye concludes in response conversations about ideas raised in the book with John Bingham-Hall, Liz Lerman, Dianne McIntyer and Richard Sennett. The book is a fascinating resource for those drawn to spatial practices from dance to design to construction.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781350185203'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1350185205'}]",True,True,177,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zdEhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zdEhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2794.0,INR,2794.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zdEhEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zdEhEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Bloomsbury Publishing

Countering common narratives of dance history that emphasize the US and Europe as centers of origin and innovation, the expansive creativity of dance artists in East Asia asserts its importance as a site of critical theorization and reflection on global artistic developments in the performing arts. Through the lens of “corporeal politics”—the close attention to bodily acts in specific cultural contexts—each study in this book challenges existing dance and theater histories to re-investigate the performer's role in devising the politics and aesthetics of their performance, as well as the multidimensional impact of their lives and artistic works. Corporeal Politics addresses a wide range of performance styles and genres, including dances produced for the concert stage, as well as those presented in popular entertainments, private performance spaces, and street protests.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780472054558'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0472054554'}]",False,True,373,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qIX3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qIX3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,University of Michigan Press

(American Ballet Theatre),No Subtitle,John Robert Allman,"A lively and encouraging picture book celebrating boys who love to dance, from the renowned American Ballet Theatre. Boys who love to dance are center stage in this encouraging, positive, rhyming picture book about guys who love to pirouette, jeté, and plié. Created in partnership with the American Ballet Theatre and with the input of their company's male dancers, here is a book that shows ballet is for everyone. Written by the acclaimed author of A Is for Audra: Broadway's Leading Ladies from A to Z, this book subtly seeks to address the prejudice toward boys and ballet by showing the skill, hard work, strength, and smarts is takes to be a dancer. Fun and buoyant illustrations show boys of a variety of ages and ethnicities, making this the ideal book for any boy who loves dance. An afterword with photos and interviews with some of ABT's male dancers completes this empowering and joyful picture book.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780593181164'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0593181166'}]",True,True,21,Juvenile Nonfiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bl_VDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bl_VDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,501.24,INR,250.62,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bl_VDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-bl_VDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020,Doubleday Books for Young Readers

DrN-AgAAQBAJ,dance,Exhausting Dance,Performance and the Politics of Movement,Andre Lepecki,"The only scholarly book in English dedicated to recent European contemporary dance, Exhausting Dance: Performance and the Politics of Movement examines the work of key contemporary choreographers who have transformed the dance scene since the early 1990s in Europe and the US. Through their vivid and explicit dialogue with performance art, visual arts and critical theory from the past thirty years, this new generation of choreographers challenge our understanding of dance by exhausting the concept of movement. Their work demands to be read as performed extensions of the radical politics implied in performance art, in post-structuralist and critical theory, in post-colonial theory, and in critical race studies. In this far-ranging and exceptional study, Andre Lepecki brilliantly analyzes the work of the choreographers: * Jerome Bel (France) * Juan Dominguez (Spain) * Trisha Brown (US) * La Ribot (Spain) * Xavier Le Roy (France-Germany) * Vera Mantero (Portugal) and visual and performance artists: * Bruce Nauman (US) * William Pope.L (US). This book offers a significant and radical revision of the way we think about dance, arguing for the necessity of a renewed engagement between dance studies and experimental artistic and philosophical practices.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781134230891'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1134230893'}]",True,True,290,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DrN-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DrN-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2006,Routledge

Chapters cover a range of topics that explore dance film, contemporary dance with film on stage, dance as an ideal medium to be captured by 3D images and videodance as kin to site-specific choreography. This book explores the ways in which early practitioners such as Loïe Fuller and Maya Deren began a conversation between media that has continued to evolve and yet still retains certain unanswered questions. Methodology for this conversation includes dance historical approaches as well as mechanical considerations. The camera is a partner, a disembodied portion of self that looks in order to reflect on, to mirror, or to presage movement. This conversation includes issues of sexuality, race, and mixed ability. Bodies and lenses share equal billing.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781137596109'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1137596104'}]",True,True,268,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w_eODAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w_eODAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,9239.4,INR,9239.4,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w_eODAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-w_eODAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,Springer

This collection of articles provides a theoretical discussion of the promises and pitfalls inherent in transplanting art forms from one culture to another; it offers practical guidance for those who might want to participate in this enterprise and explains the general history of the dance exchange to date. It also identifies the differences that are unique to specific cultures, such as the development of theatrical forms, arts education, and the status of artists. This is a first examination of a phenomenon that has already touched most people in the arts community worldwide, and that none can afford to ignore. A lively dialogue has evolved over the last few decades between dance professionals -- performers, teachers and administrators -- in the United States and Europe and their counterparts in Asia and the Pacific rim.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781134361014'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1134361017'}]",True,True,374,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q_ZYCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q_ZYCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,5940.12,INR,5940.12,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q_ZYCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-q_ZYCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,Routledge

PmKDDwAAQBAJ,dance,Dance Composition Basics,No Subtitle,Pamela Anderson Sofras,"If the saying “To be the best, you must learn from the best” holds true, then this book is gold for all aspiring dancers. Dance Composition Basics, Second Edition, doesn’t just feature the works and brilliance of dance and choreographic legends Alonzo King and Dwight Rhoden—it is completely based on the choreographic operations and forms in three of their original works: Chants and Dreamer by King and Verge by Rhoden. All compositional exercises in the book are based on those three works, and the book itself is expertly crafted by Pamela Anderson Sofras, who has 34 years of experience teaching dance at the university level. Dance Composition Basics, designed for beginning dance composition courses, introduces dancers to choreography through a series of problem-solving activities. The activities are starting points for novice dancers to embark on their own attempts at choreography. Useful Tools The book offers several useful tools for instructors: 27 lesson plans that draw from and highlight selected portions of original compositions by King and Rhoden 33 reproducible assessment and self-evaluation forms An instructor guide that includes a sample course syllabus plus written exams for each chapter PowerPoint presentations to guide students through each lesson A web resource featuring online videos that are closely tied to the lesson plans and provide a richer learning experience for students; students can access this resource inside or outside of class Highly Valuable Video Resource The videos give students access to Alonzo King and Dwight Rhoden, highly successful and respected choreographers, who share their processes and techniques. Many video clips show the choreographers working on the same movement concepts featured in the corresponding lesson. Students will see the choreographers in action with professional dancers as they develop the movement material for each dance. Because students get to see the choreographers and dancers struggling with the same creative concepts they have been assigned, these clips add tremendous value to Dance Composition. Book and Web Resource Organization The text is split into five chapters, each of which features several lessons based on that chapter’s choreographic concept. Each lesson contains the following: An introductory statement and a vocabulary list A warm-up to prepare the body and focus the mind Structured improvisations that help dancers understand the movement concepts of the lesson Problem-solving activities that allow dancers to apply the concepts presented in the improvisations Discussion questions to engage dancers and promote understanding Assessment rubrics to guide evaluation of each dancer’s learning At the end of the book, a glossary provides definitions for the vocabulary terms introduced in the chapters. The main menu of the web resource corresponds with the five chapters in the book. To guide students’ use of the videos, icons have been placed throughout the book, referring readers to additional information in the web resource. Reviewing the videos will provide further insight into the choreographic assignment. The web resource also contains all the discussion questions, assessments, and evaluations found in the book. Instructors can distribute these to students electronically or print them out. Instructors can also adapt the forms to meet their specific needs. The web resource is included with all new print books and some ebooks. For ebook formats that don’t provide access, the web resource is available separately. The Learning Process Dance Composition takes students through a systematic learning process: reading about a concept, discussing the concept, seeing the concept played out on video with professional choreographers and dancers, and exploring the concept through their own movement ideas. Through this process, which includes structured improvisations, students discover a movement vocabulary and original dance phrases. They then more fully develop their movement ideas, with specific movement assignments, and are given feedback by their peers and the instructor. Invaluable Resource Dance Composition Basics, Second Edition, is an invaluable resource for dancers of all styles, from ballet to modern jazz, as it introduces them to some of the compositional structures used by professional choreographers. Through the carefully designed lessons in the book and the expert examples on the video clips, students can use this resource to take their first confident and exhilarating steps into the craft of choreography.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781492589815'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1492589810'}]",True,True,257,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PmKDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PmKDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,5461.44,INR,5461.44,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PmKDDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-PmKDDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Human Kinetics

This volume contributes to a growing discourse on the potential of dance and dancers to affect change, politics and situational awareness, as well as to traverse disciplinary boundaries. It â ~undisciplinesâ (TM) academic thinking through its organisation into â ~movementsâ (TM) and â ~stumblesâ (TM), reinforcing its theme through its structure as well as its content, addressing contemporary dance and performance practices and pedagogies from a range of research perspectives and registers. Turbulent and vertiginous events on the world stage necessitate new ways of thinking and acting. This book makes strides towards a new kind of research which creates alternative modes for perceiving, experiencing and making. Through writings and images, its contributions offer different perspectives on how to rethink disciplinarity through choreographic practices, somatics, a reimagining of dance techniques, indigenous ontologies, choreopolitics, critical dance pedagogies and visual performance languages.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1527570959'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781527570955'}]",False,False,0,Uncategorized,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2lqLzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2lqLzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2021,Cambridge Scholars Publishing
9LpipUSwdqwC,dance,Streetlights and Shadows,Searching for the Keys to Adaptive Decision Making,Gary A. Klein,"An expert explains how the conventional wisdom about decision making can get us into trouble—and why experience can’t be replaced by rules, procedures, or analytical methods In making decisions, when should we go with our gut and when should we try to analyze every option? When should we use our intuition and when should we rely on logic and statistics? Most of us would probably agree that for important decisions, we should follow certain guidelines—gather as much information as possible, compare the options, pin down the goals before getting started. But in practice we make some of our best decisions by adapting to circumstances rather than blindly following procedures. In Streetlights and Shadows, Gary Klein debunks the conventional wisdom about how to make decisions. He takes ten commonly accepted claims about decision making and shows that they are better suited for the laboratory than for life. The standard advice works well when everything is clear, but the tough decisions involve shadowy conditions of complexity and ambiguity. Gathering masses of information, for example, works if the information is accurate and complete—but that doesn't often happen in the real world. (Think about the careful risk calculations that led to the downfall of the Wall Street investment houses.) Klein offers more realistic ideas about how to make decisions in real-life settings. He provides many examples—ranging from airline pilots and weather forecasters to sports announcers and Captain Jack Aubrey in Patrick O’Brian’s Master and Commander novels—to make his point. All these decision makers saw things that others didn’t. They used their expertise to pick up cues and to discern patterns and trends. We can make better decisions, Klein tells us, if we are prepared for complexity and ambiguity and if we will stop expecting the data to tell us everything. “I know of no one who combines theory and observation—intellectual rigor and painstaking observation of the real world—so brilliantly and gracefully as Gary Klein.” —Malcolm Gladwell, author of Outliers and Blink","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262258340'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '026225834X'}]",True,True,355,Business & Economics,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9LpipUSwdqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9LpipUSwdqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",2,4.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1714.54,INR,1714.54,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9LpipUSwdqwC&rdid=book-9LpipUSwdqwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2011,MIT Press

Yb8DFuGmyNYC,dance,Crimea,No Subtitle,Orlando Figes,"The terrible conflict that dominated the mid 19th century, the Crimean War killed at least 800,000 men and pitted Russia against a formidable coalition of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. It was a war for territory, provoked by fear that if the Ottoman Empire were to collapse then Russia could control a huge swathe of land from the Balkans to the Persian Gulf. But it was also a war of religion, driven by a fervent, populist and ever more ferocious belief by the Tsar and his ministers that it was Russia's task to rule all Orthodox Christians and control the Holy Land. Orlando Figes' major new book reimagines this extraordinary war, in which the stakes could not have been higher and which was fought with a terrible mixture of ferocity and incompetence. It was both a recognisably modern conflict - the first to be extensively photographed, the first to employ the telegraph, the first 'newspaper war' - and a traditional one, with illiterate soldiers, amateur officers and huge casualties caused by disease. Drawing on a huge range of fascinating sources, Figes also gives the lived experience of the war, from that of the ordinary British soldier in his snow-filled trench, to the haunted, gloomy, narrow figure of Tsar Nicholas himself as he vows to take on the whole world in his hunt for religious salvation.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781846145001'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1846145007'}]",True,False,451,History,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yb8DFuGmyNYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yb8DFuGmyNYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,618.61,INR,309.3,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yb8DFuGmyNYC&rdid=book-Yb8DFuGmyNYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2011,Penguin UK

In this insightful new book, Mark Franko explores the many genres of theatrical dancing during the radical decade of the 1930s and their relationship to labor movements, including Fordist and unionist organizational structures, the administrative structures of the Federal Dance and Theatre Project, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, and the Communist Party. Franko shows how the structures of labor organization were reproduced and acted out — but also profoundly reasoned through in corporeal terms — by choreography and performance of the proletarian mass dance, the chorus line of the Ziegfeld Follies and the reflexive backstage musical film, Martha Graham's modern dance, the revolutionary dance movement of the proletarian avant-garde, African-American ""ethnic"" opera-ballet, and Lincoln Kirstein's ""American"" ballet. The contributions of many important personalities of American theatrical, visual and literary culture are included in this study.

0fU-DwAAQBAJ,dance,The Anatomy of Dance Discourse,Literary and Philosophical Approaches to Dance in the Later Graeco-Roman World,Karin Schlapbach,"Within the newly thriving field of ancient Greek and Roman performance and dance studies, The Anatomy of Dance Discourse offers a fresh and original perspective on ancient perceptions of dance. Focusing on the second century CE, it provides an overview of the dance discourse of this period and explores the conceptualization of dance across an array of different texts, from Plutarch and Lucian of Samosata, to the apocryphal Acts of John, Longus, and Apuleius. The volume is divided into two Parts: while the second Part discusses ekphraseis of dance performance in prose and poetry of the Roman imperial period, the first delves more deeply into an examination of how both philosophical and literary treatments of dance interacted with other areas of cultural expression, whether language and poetry, rhetoric and art, or philosophy and religion. Its distinctive contribution lies in this juxtaposition of ancient theorizations of dance and philosophical analyses of the medium with literary depictions of dance scenes and performances, and it attends not only to the highly encoded genre of pantomime, which dominated the stage in the Roman empire, but also to acrobatic, non-representational dances. This twofold nature of dance sparked highly sophisticated reflections on the relationship between dance and meaning in the ancient world, and the volume defends the novel claim that in the imperial period it became more and more palpable that dance, unlike painting or sculpture, could be representational or not a performance of nothing but itself. It argues that dance was understood as a practice in which human beings, whether as dancers or spectators, are confronted with the irreducible reality of their own physical existence, which is constantly changing, and that its way to cognition and action is physical experience.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780198807728'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0198807724'}]",False,True,352,History,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0fU-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0fU-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2018,Oxford University Press

Addressing issues and developments relating to the workplace of dance, the text explores what it means to transcend the boundary between dance as passion, and dance as employment. Chapters explore challenges of professional practice including limitations on access, precarity, bodily risk, gender inequality, and sexual harassment, and challenge the status quo to offer readers new ways of thinking about dance, and how this might translate into professional practice and work. Ultimately celebrating the passion which motivates dancers to embark on a professional career, and highlighting the elation and joy which such employment can bring, this volume encourages dance professionals, students, and educators to imagine things differently and develop teaching approaches, curricula, work places, and communities which capitalise on the diversity and dedication of individuals in the field. This text will be of great interest to graduate and postgraduate students, researchers, academics, professionals in the field of Dance, Dance Education, Choreography and related art forms, Curriculum studies and Sociology of Education.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0367421372'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780367421373'}]",False,False,136,Uncategorized,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1FnTygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1FnTygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,Unknown Publisher
YBGIDwAAQBAJ,dance,The Oxford Handbook of Improvisation in Dance,No Subtitle,Vida L. Midgelow,"From the dance floor of a tango club to group therapy classes, from ballet to community theatre, improvised dance is everywhere. For some dance artists, improvisation is one of many approaches within the choreographic process. For others, it is a performance form in its own right. And while it has long been practiced, it is only within the last twenty years that dance improvisation has become a topic of critical inquiry. With The Oxford Handbook of Improvisation in Dance, dancer, teacher, and editor Vida L. Midgelow provides a cutting-edge volume on dance improvisation in all its facets. Expanding beyond conventional dance frameworks, this handbook looks at the ways that dance improvisation practices reflect our ability to adapt, communicate, and respond to our environment. Throughout the handbook, case studies from a variety of disciplines showcase the role of individual agency and collective relationships in improvisation, not just to dancers but to people of all backgrounds and abilities. In doing so, chapters celebrate all forms of improvisation, and unravel the ways that this kind of movement informs understandings of history, socio-cultural conditions, lived experience, cognition, and technologies.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780199397006'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0199397007'}]",False,True,833,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YBGIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YBGIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3503.24,INR,3503.24,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YBGIDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YBGIDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Oxford University Press

6Hk8CwAAQBAJ,dance,Getting Started in Ballet,A Parent's Guide to Dance Education,Anna Paskevska,"In Getting Started in Ballet, A Parent's Guide to Dance Education, authors Anna Paskevska and Maureen Janson comprehensively present the realities that parents can anticipate during their child's training and/or career in ballet. It can be daunting and confusing when parents discover their child's desire to dance. Parental guidance and education about dance study typically comes from trial by fire. This book expertly guides the parental decision-making process by weaving practical advice together with useful information about dance history and the author's own memoir. From selecting a teacher in the early stages, to supporting a child through his or her choice to dance professionally, parents of prospective dancers are lead through a series of considerations, and encouraged to think carefully and to make wise decisions. Written primarily as a guide book for parents, it is just as useful for teachers, and this exemplary document would do well to have a place on the bookshelf in every dance studio waiting room. Not only can dance parents learn from this informative text, but dance teachers can be nudged toward a greater understanding and anticipation of parents needs and questions. Getting Started in Ballet fills a gap, conveniently under one cover, welcoming parents to regard every aspect of their child's possible future in dance. Without this book, there would be little documentation of the parenting aspect of dance. Dance is unlike any other training or field and knowing how to guide a young dancer can make or break them as a dancer or dance lover.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780190226213'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0190226218'}]",True,True,233,Music,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6Hk8CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6Hk8CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,436.86,INR,305.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6Hk8CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-6Hk8CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,Oxford University Press

_EiRvgEACAAJ,dance,Dance Into Business,"A How-To-Guide for Dance Students, Teachers and Professionals",Richard Thom,"Dance into Business is intended primarily as a guide for dance students, teachers and professionals taking up their first teaching post, planning their own business, setting up a freelance career, contemplating a change in career, transitioning from employment to self-employment, returning to the work place and expanding or selling an existing business. Using insight from working in the dance world, chapters containing helpful tips, practical examples, and points to consider cover topics such as: Choosing your options; Going self-employed; Writing a business plan; Choosing a business name; Choosing a business structure; Using financial tools; Costing your business; Setting fees; Analysing cash flow; Funding; Paying taxes; Up and running Operating; Complying with the law; Attracting customers; Engaging freelancers; Using volunteers; Expanding; and Buying (or selling) a business.Dance into Business looks at demystifying some of the concepts around employment and self-employment. It looks at different types of employment and the main stages of getting into business: preparation, planning, setting up and starting out. It explains the principals of business plans, budgets, costing, pricing, cash flow, break-even, finance, operations, and other issues that can be key components to a successful business. The author assumes readers could be living and working anywhere in the world and therefore the book has not been written to answer specific queries relating to individual cases or jurisdictions. However the types of business and laws described in this book are generally those of the United Kingdom, although similarities exist in many countries. Because of this complexity, Dance into Business should be read as a guide or general overview, the examples and exercises illustrative only and readers should always seek appropriate professional advice as formal legal, accounting, or other professional advice has not been given in this book. Although not suitable for all individuals, businesses or situations, many of the principles can be applied to other dance businesses such as productions, conferences, workshops, and course provision, or to other products and services.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1789265428'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781789265422'}]",False,False,280,Dance,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_EiRvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_EiRvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2018,Unknown Publisher

zGGvEAAAQBAJ,dance,The Tamil Padam,A Dance Music Genre of South India,Matthew Harp Allen,"This book is a study of the Bharata Natyam dance genre ""padam"" focusing on its patrons and composers and its formal structure, texts, and music. It examines the ""rewriting"" of South Indian dance and the decades-long debates over the classicization and ownership of South Indian music. The control over the representation of the arts is a subject that should resonate with scholars working in a wide variety of genres and across many countries. The study is diachronic (historical) and also synchronic (examining padams’ organizational structure as a system). Importantly, the text includes 30 Tamil language songs, minutely translated and annotated together with a documentation of their performance history in the 20th century. Classical and modern music composers and performers, ethnomusicologists, librettists, singers, choreographers, art historians, dancers, dance scholars, and dance teachers will find them useful in giving students a deep contextual understanding of Bharata Natyam.

Together they keep the world warm, the gardens growing, and the sky full of beautiful rainbows. But one day they get into a fight and refuse to be in the sky together. And that means there are no longer any rainbows. Without rainbows, the colors start disappearing until Earth was left with no color … except for one little forgotten box of crayons in one little school desk. Determined to save the rainbows and fix the Sun and Clouds’ friendship, the crayons draw rainbows all over town. Their attempts go unnoticed. Soon they realize that they’re going to have to do something big to get the attention of the former friends. So, the crayons create the biggest rainbow they can and hope it’s enough to bring color back to the world. How the Crayons Saved the Rainbow teaches the importance of teamwork and perseverance through seven crayons with unique personalities and their desire to see the world in color.

Ella Blythe knows this. Still, she cannot help but hope her own story may turn out different than most--and certainly different than the tragic story of the Ghost of Craven Street Theater. Yet as she struggles to maintain her tenuous place in the ever-shrinking ballet company, win the attentions of principal dancer Philippe, and avoid company flirt Jack, Ella cannot deny the uncanny feeling that her life is mirroring that of the dead ballerina. Is she dancing ever closer to the edge of her own tragic end? Or will the secrets that are about to come to light offer release from the past? Mystery and romance make the perfect dance partners in this evocative story from fan-favorite Joanna Davidson Politano.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781493431816'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1493431811'}]",True,False,250,Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LEQgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LEQgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",2,4.5,IN,FOR_SALE,True,441.32,INR,308.92,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LEQgEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-LEQgEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Revell

Z9QaCmsSGf8C,dance,The Music of Life,Biology beyond genes,Denis Noble,"What is Life? Decades of research have resulted in the full mapping of the human genome - three billion pairs of code whose functions are only now being understood. The gene's eye view of life, advocated by evolutionary biology, sees living bodies as mere vehicles for the replication of the genetic codes. But for a physiologist, working with the living organism, the view is a very different one. Denis Noble is a world renowned physiologist, and sets out an alternative view to the question - one that becomes deeply significant in terms of the living, breathing organism. The genome is not life itself. Noble argues that far from genes building organisms, they should be seen as prisoners of the organism. The view of life presented in this little, modern, post-genome project reflection on the nature of life, is that of the systems biologist: to understand what life is, we must view it at a variety of different levels, all interacting with each other in a complex web. It is that emergent web, full of feedback between levels, from the gene to the wider environment, that is life. It is a kind of music. Including stories from Noble's own research experience, his work on the heartbeat, musical metaphors, and elements of linguistics and Chinese culture, this very personal and at times deeply lyrical book sets out the systems biology view of life.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780191578809'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0191578800'}]",True,True,169,Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z9QaCmsSGf8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z9QaCmsSGf8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",1,3.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,436.86,INR,305.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z9QaCmsSGf8C&rdid=book-Z9QaCmsSGf8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2008,OUP Oxford

Dreams of pirouettes and grande jetes, dreams of attending the best ballet schools and of dancing starring roles on stage. But in Harlem in the 1950s, dreams don’t always come true—they take a lot of work and a lot of hope. And sometimes hope is hard to come by. But the first African-American prima ballerina, Janet Collins, did make her dreams come true. And those dreams inspired ballerinas everywhere, showing them that the color of their skin couldn’t stop them from becoming a star. In a lyrical tale as beautiful as a dance en pointe, Kristy Dempsey and Floyd Cooper tell the story of one little ballerina who was inspired by Janet Collins to make her own dreams come true.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698152915'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698152913'}]",True,True,36,Juvenile Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Wo2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Wo2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,573.03,INR,286.52,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Wo2AAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3Wo2AAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2014,Penguin

Z4DSEAAAQBAJ,dance,Holding On to the Air,An Autobiography,Suzanne Farrell,"Suzanne Farrell, world-renowned ballerina, was one of George Balanchine's most celebrated muses and remains a legendary figure in the ballet world. This memoir, first published in 1990 and reissued with a new preface by the author, recounts Farrell's transformation from a young girl in Ohio dreaming of greatness to the realization of that dream on stages all over the world. Central to this transformation was her relationship with George Balanchine, who invited her to join the New York City Ballet in the fall of 1961 and was in turn inspired by her unique combination of musical, physical, and dramatic gifts. He created masterpieces for her in which the limits of ballet technique were expanded to a degree not seen before. By the time she retired from the stage in 1989, Farrell had achieved a career that is without precedent in the history of ballet. One third of her repertory of more than 100 ballets were composed expressly for her by such notable choreographers as Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Maurice Bejart. Farrell recalls professional and personal attachments and their attendant controversies with a down-to-earth frankness and common sense that complements the glories and mysteries of her artistic achievement.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780813059327'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0813059321'}]",True,True,498,Biography & Autobiography,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z4DSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z4DSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2002,University Press of Florida

aSL7kHUhCHwC,dance,"Theatre History Studies 2014, Vol. 33",Theatres of War,Elizabeth Reitz Mullenix,"Volume 33 of Theatre History Studies explores war. War is a paradox—horrifying and compelling, galvanizing and devastating, a phenomenon that separates and decimates while at the same time creating and strengthening national identity and community bonds. War is the stuff of great drama. War and theatre is a subject of increasing popularity among scholars of theatre. The essays in this special edition of Theatre History Studies brings together a unique collection of work by thirteen innovative scholars whose work explores such topics as theatre performances during war times, theatre written and performed to resist war, and theatre that fosters and promotes war. The contributors to this volume write poignantly about nationhood and about how war—through both propaganda and protest—defines a people. The contributors also delve into numerous fascinating themes that transcend time, peoples, nations, and particular conflicts: the foundations of nationalism and the concepts of occupied and occupier, nostalgia and utopia, and patriotism and revolution. These essays survey a march of civil and international wars spanning three centuries. Arranged chronologically, they invite comparisons between themes and trace the development of the major themes of war. Ideas manifest in the theatre of one period recall ideologies and propaganda of the past, reflect those of the present, and anticipate wars to come.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0817358072'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780817358075'}]",False,False,324,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aSL7kHUhCHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aSL7kHUhCHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2014,University Alabama Press

Jimmy Santiago Baca’s “astonishing narrative” of his life before, during, and immediately after the years he spent in the maximum-security prison garnered tremendous critical acclaim. An important chronicle that “affirms the triumph of the human spirit,” it went on to win the prestigious 2001 International Prize (Arizona Daily Star). Long considered one of the best poets in America today, Baca was illiterate at the age of twenty-one when he was sentenced to five years in Florence State Prison for selling drugs in Arizona.

DX3SEAAAQBAJ,dance,Winter Season,"A Dancer's Journal, with a new preface",Toni Bentley,"An irresistible inside look at one of the world's great dance companies, Winter Season is also a sensitive, intimate, and almost painfully honest account of the emotional and intellectual development of a young woman dedicated to one of the most demanding of all the arts. Bentley's association with the New York City Ballet began when she was accepted by the affiliated School of American Ballet at the age of eleven. Seven years later, she became a member of the company. In the fall of 1980, as the winter season opened, she found herself facing an emotional crisis: her dancing was not going well. At 22 she felt that her life had lost direction. To try to make something of her experience, on paper if not on stage, she began to keep a journal, describing her day-to-day activities and looking back on her past. The result is perhaps the closest that most of us will ever come to knowing what it feels like to be a dancer, on stage and off. It also offers memorable glimpses of some notable members of the City ballet, with, at the center, the man whose vision they all served--George Balanchine.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780813040929'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0813040922'}]",True,True,163,Biography & Autobiography,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DX3SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DX3SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2003,University Press of Florida

rVLXDwAAQBAJ,dance,What You Become in Flight,A Memoir,Ellen O'Connell Whittet,"""Poignant and exquisite""--The Los Angeles Review of Books ""An inspiring and powerful book""--Booklist ""A genuinely absorbing read""--Kirkus ""Revelatory, honest, and wondrous.""--Chanel Miller, author of Know My Name A lyrical and meditative memoir on the damage we inflict in the pursuit of perfection, the pain of losing our dreams, and the power of letting go of both. With a promising career in classical ballet ahead of her, Ellen O'Connell Whittet was devastated when a misstep in rehearsal caused a career-ending injury. Ballet was the love of her life. She lived for her moments under the glare of the stage-lights--gliding through the air, pretending however fleetingly to effortlessly defy gravity. Yet with a debilitating injury forcing her to reconsider her future, she also began to reconsider what she had taken for granted in her past. Beneath every perfect arabesque was a foot, disfigured by pointe shoes, stuffed--taped and bleeding--into a pink, silk slipper. Behind her ballerina's body was a young girl starving herself into a fragile collection of limbs. Within her love of ballet was a hatred of herself for struggling to achieve the perfection it demanded of her. In this raw and redemptive debut memoir, Ellen O'Connell Whittet explores the silent suffering of the ballerina--and finds it emblematic of the violence that women quietly shoulder every day. For O'Connell Whittet, letting go of one meant confronting the other--only then was it possible to truly take flight.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781612198323'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1612198325'}]",False,False,241,Biography & Autobiography,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rVLXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rVLXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,Melville House

Tt-sCAAAQBAJ,dance,Up to This Pointe,No Subtitle,Jennifer Longo,"Harper had a plan. It went south. Hand this utterly unique contemporary YA to anyone who loves ballet or is a little too wrapped up in their Plan A. (It's okay to fail, people!) Harper Scott is a dancer. She and her best friend, Kate, have one goal: becoming professional ballerinas. And Harper won’t let anything—or anyone—get in the way of The Plan, not even the boy she and Kate are both drawn to. Harper is a Scott. She’s related to Robert Falcon Scott, the explorer who died racing Amundsen and Shackleton to the South Pole. Amundsen won because he had a plan, and Harper has always followed his model. So when Harper’s life takes an unexpected turn, she finagles (read: lies) her way to the icy dark of McMurdo Station . . . in Antarctica. Extreme, but somehow fitting—apparently she has always been in the dark, dancing on ice this whole time. And no one warned her. Not her family, not her best friend, not even the boy who has somehow found a way into her heart. It will take a visit from Shackleton's ghost--the explorer who didn't make it to the South Pole, but who got all of his men out alive--to teach Harper that success isn't always what's important, sometimes it's more important to learn how to fail successfully.

He then provides a historical overview of thye events in question, beginning with the decision and program to build the atomic bomb.

Finally, Kort examines ten key issues in the discussion of Hiroshima and guides readers to relevant primary source documents, scholarly books, and articles.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780231131452'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0231131453'}]",False,True,138,Social Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cITGAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cITGAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2004,Columbia University Press

3HlpxAEACAAJ,dance,A Guru’s Journey,Pandit Chitresh Das and Indian Classical Dance in Diaspora,Sarah Morelli,"An important modern exponent of Asian dance, Pandit Chitresh Das brought kathak to the United States in 1970. The North Indian classical dance has since become an important art form within the greater Indian diaspora. Yet its adoption outside of India raises questions about what happens to artistic practices when we separate them from their broader cultural contexts. A Guru's Journey provides an ethnographic study of the dance form in the San Francisco Bay Area community formed by Das. Sarah Morelli, a kathak dancer and one of Das's former students, investigates issues in teaching, learning, and performance that developed around Das during his time in the United States. In modifying kathak's form and teaching for Western students, Das negotiates questions of Indianness and non-Indianness, gender, identity, and race. Morelli lays out these issues for readers with the goal of deepening their knowledge of kathak aesthetics, technique, and theory. She also shares the intricacies of footwork, facial expression in storytelling, and other aspects of kathak while tying them to the cultural issues that inform the dance.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0252084683'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780252084683'}]",False,False,0,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3HlpxAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3HlpxAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2019,University of Illinois Press

SmRgDgAAQBAJ,dance,Danza!,Amalia Hernández and El Ballet Folklórico de México,Duncan Tonatiuh,"Award-winning author and illustrator Duncan Tonatiuh tells the story of Amalia Hernández, dancer and founder of El Ballet Folklórico de México. Published in time for the 100th anniversary of Hernández’s birth, Danza! is the first picture book about the famous dancer and choreographer. Danza! is a celebration of Hernández’s life and of the rich history of dance in Mexico. As a child, Amalia always thought she would grow up to be a teacher, until she saw a performance of dancers in her town square. She was fascinated by the way the dancers twirled and swayed, and she knew that someday she would be a dancer, too. She began to study many different types of dance, including ballet and modern, under some of the best teachers in the world. Hernández traveled throughout Mexico studying and learning regional dances. Soon she founded her own dance company, El Ballet Folklórico de México, where she integrated her knowledge of ballet and modern dance with folkloric dances. The group began to perform all over the country and soon all over the world, becoming an international sensation that still tours today. Duncan Tonatiuh’s picture books have been honored with many awards and accolades, including the Pura Belpré Award, the Robert F. Sibert Award, and the New York Times Best Illustrated Book Award. With Tonatiuh’s distinctive Mixtec-inspired artwork and colorful drawings that seem to leap off the page, Danza! will enthrall and inspire young readers with the fascinating story of this important dancer and choreographer.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781683351108'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '168335110X'}]",True,True,32,Juvenile Nonfiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SmRgDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SmRgDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1757.59,INR,1757.59,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SmRgDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-SmRgDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2017,Abrams

fhTXPAAACAAJ,dance,"Kathaka, the Tradition",Fusion and Diffusion,Ranjana Srivastava,"The book traces the history of Kathaka from ancient to the medieval period: its origin and continuous evolution in a struggle for existence through a process involving fusion, diffusion and adaptation. It studies its etymological meaning in a painstaking effort which involves a discussion on the influence of Kathakya Acarya, Sage Katha and the generic similarities between Rasalila, Hallisaka, Carcari, Rasa, and present-day Kathaka. It shows that Kathaka has an ancient origin and is an indigenous Indian dance. It deals with the three distinct sections that form the present-day Kathaka. Surveying a host of religious and secular literature including the Natyasastra, the Abhinaya Darpana and the Sangita Ratnakara and referring to sculptural reliefs from temples and illustrations from manuscripts including the Akbar-Nama, it undertakes a detailed and illuminating study of gestures, postures, movements and stances of Kathaka.

It's a competitive and physically and mentally demanding career that combines elite athleticism, artistry, and performance.

In The Ballerina Mindset, she shares all the wisdom she's learned from her nearly two-decade career, drawing upon her own experiences to show us how she learned to overcome challenges ranging from stage fright to negative feedback to a packed calendar to weight management--and how we can do the same.

J-OHduo4lPcC,dance,Yelesalehe Hiwayona Dikanohogida Naiwodusv,No Subtitle,Qwo-Li Driskill,"""This dissertation examines the importance of performed and embodied rhetorics to Cherokee survival and resistance and argues for performance as a primary site of Native cultural continuance and rhetorical production. Two historiographic studies are central to making this argument. The first, Indian In The Archive: Performance Historiography as Cherokee Ghost Dance (Chapter Three) looks to the Cherokee Ghost Dance and the Redbird Smith movement as models for radical, decolonial, performative historiography. With a particular focus on recovering a history of nineteenth century Cherokee theatre, this chapter focuses on how archives are and can be used by Cherokee people to re-establish dormant and/or obscured Cherokee performance traditions and histories. The second study, On The Wings Of Wadaduga: Towards the Performance of Two-Spirit Critiques (Chapter Four) focuses on revising both archived and embodied records through the development of an historiographic performance with Two-Spirit, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer-identified Cherokees. This chapter examines performance as historiography and argues for performance as a means to revise both archival and embodied cultural memories. Both studies are grounded in the methodological concepts of [special characters omitted] (duyuk'ta, ""balance"") and [special characters omitted] (gadugi, ""cooperative labor"") as a way of conceiving decolonial scholarship, practice, and pedagogy within the field of rhetoric and composition""--Abstract.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'MSU:31293029567157'}]",False,False,602,Cherokee Indians,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J-OHduo4lPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J-OHduo4lPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2008,Unknown Publisher

DymoBAAAQBAJ,dance,Ballerina,"Sex, Scandal, and Suffering Behind the Symbol of Perfection",Deirdre Kelly,"Throughout her history, the ballerina has been perceived as the embodiment of beauty and perfection--the feminine ideal. But the reality is another story. From the earliest ballerinas in the 17th century--who often led double lives as concubines--through the poverty of the corps de ballet dancers in the 1800's and the anorexic and bulimic ballerinas of George Balanchine, starvation and exploitation have plagued ballerinas throughout history. Using the stories of great dancers such as Anna Pavlova, Isadora Duncan, Suzanne Farrell, Gelsey Kirkland, Evelyn Hart, Marie Camargo, and Misty Copeland, Deirdre Kelly exposes the true rigors for women in ballet. She rounds her critique with examples of how the world of ballet is slowly evolving for the better. But to ensure that this most graceful of dance forms survives into the future, she says that the time has come to rethink ballet, to position the ballerina at its center and accord her the respect she deserves.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781771640008'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1771640006'}]",False,True,264,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DymoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DymoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2012,Greystone Books Ltd

However, little is known about the experiences of young men who choose to take dance classes in non-professional settings. Dancing Boys is one of the first scholarly works to demystify the largely unknown challenges of adolescent males in dance. Through an ethnographic study of sixty-two adolescent male students, Zihao Li captures the authentic stories and experiences of boys participating in dance classes in a public high school in Toronto. Accompanied by the boys’ artwork and photographs and supported by a documentary-style video, the study explores their motivations for dancing, their reflections on masculinity and gender, and the internal and external factors that impact their decisions to continue to dance professionally or in informal settings. With the author’s reflections on his own journey as a professional dancer woven throughout, Dancing Boys will spark discussion on how and why educators can engage adolescent males in dance.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781442617469'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1442617462'}]",True,False,192,Education,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QFeHDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QFeHDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2016,University of Toronto Press

Flitch is sharply critical of this decline, but sees a light on the horizon in the shape of the arrival of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, whose dancers and early performances he discusses in some detail. The chapters are: The ancient and modern attitude towards the dance, The rise of the ballet, The heyday of the ballet, The Skirt dance, The Serpentine Dance, The high kickers, The revival of classical dancing, The Imperial Russian Ballet, The repertory of the Russian Ballet, The Russian dancers, The English Ballet, Oriental and Spanish dancing, The revival of the Morris Dance, and The future of the dance.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1906830134'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781906830137'}]",False,False,326,Performing Arts,en,Unknown,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2010,Unknown Publisher

75r6DwAAQBAJ,dance,The Passion of Music and Dance,"Body, Gender and Sexuality",William Washabaugh,"The late nineteenth century witnessed the birth and popularization of a number of highly emotional musical styles that played on the eagerness of modern Europeans and Americans to toy with the limits of sanity and to taste the ecstasies of living on the edge. This absorbing book explores these popular, passionate musical styles -- which include flamenco, tango and rebetika -- and points out that they arose as well-intentioned intellectuals co-opted the emotional experiences most closely associated with women. In drawing those experiences out of female practice, they defined, objectified, and turned them into strategies of domination, the deepest impact of which was felt, ironically, by modern women.In bridging anthropology, sociology, cultural, media, body and gender studies, this book broadens the base of theory which has ignored the transnational world of Latin and Mediterranean popular culture and makes a powerful statement about the intersection of nationalism, sexuality, identity and authenticity.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000324150'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '100032415X'}]",True,True,182,Music,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=75r6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=75r6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,4796.7,INR,4796.7,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=75r6DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-75r6DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020,Routledge

HhxQEAAAQBAJ,dance,"Dance, Architecture and Engineering",No Subtitle,Adesola Akinleye,"This book was born from a year of exchanges of movement ideas generated in cross-practice conversations and workshops with dancers, musicians, architects and engineers. Events took place at key cultural institutions such as the Royal Academy of Arts, London; and The Lowry, Salford, as well as on-site at architectural firms and on the streets of London. The author engages with dance's offer of perspectives on being in place: how the 'ordinary person' is facilitated in experiencing the dance of the city, while also looking at shared cross-practice understandings in and about the body, weight and rhythm. There is a prioritizing of how embodied knowledges across dance, architecture and engineering can contribute to decolonizing the production of place – in particular, how dance and city-making cultures engage with female bodies and non-white bodies in today's era of #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. Akinleye concludes in response conversations about ideas raised in the book with John Bingham-Hall, Liz Lerman, Dianne McIntyer and Richard Sennett. The book is a fascinating resource for those drawn to spatial practices from dance to design to construction.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781350185234'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '135018523X'}]",True,False,0,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HhxQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HhxQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2022,Dance in Dialogue

h3bADAAAQBAJ,dance,Albion's Dance,British Ballet during the Second World War,Karen Eliot,"When the Second World War broke out, ballet in Britain was only a few decades old. Few had imagined that it would establish roots in a nation long thought to be unresponsive to dance. Nevertheless, the war proved to be a boon for ballet dancers, choreographers and audiences, for the nation's dancers were forced to look inward to their own identity and sources of creativity. As author Karen Eliot demonstrates in this fascinating book, instead of withering during the enforced isolation of war, ballet in Britain flourished, exhibiting a surprising heterogeneity and vibrant populism that moved ballet outside its typical elitist surroundings to be seen by uninitiated, often enthusiastic audiences. Ballet was thought to help boost audience morale, to render solace to the soul-weary and to afford entertainment and diversion to those who simply craved a few hours of distraction. Government authorities came to see that ballet could serve as a tool of propaganda; the ways it functioned within the larger public discourse of propaganda and sacrifice, and how it answered a public mood of pragmatism and idealism, are also topics in this story of the development of a national ballet identity. This narrative has several key players-- dance critics, male and female dancers, producers, audiences, and choreographers. Exploring the so-called ""ballet boom"" during WWII, the larger story of this book is one of how art and artists thrive during conflict, and how they respond pragmatically and creatively to privation and duress.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780190622428'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0190622423'}]",True,True,241,Music,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h3bADAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h3bADAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1513.02,INR,1513.02,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h3bADAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-h3bADAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,Oxford University Press
YllOEAAAQBAJ,dance,Dance Me to the End of Love,No Subtitle,Leonard Cohen,"10 years ago, Welcome Books published the star of its Art & Poetry Series, Dance Me to the End of Love, a deliriously romantic song by Leonard Cohen that was brilliantly visualized through the sensual paintings of Henri Matisse. Now for its 10-year anniversary, Welcome is thrilled to present the entirely re-imagined and redesigned Dance Me to the End of Love. With the art of Matisse and the words of Cohen still at the heart of the book, the new look and feel of this Art & Poetry book is overwhelmingly beautiful. Cohen's song is a lyrical tribute to the miracle of love, the grace it bestows on us and its healing, restorative power. Originally recorded on his Various Positions album, and featured in Cohen's anthology, Stranger Music, this poetic song is gloriously married to the art works by Henri Matisse, perhaps the greatest artist of the twentieth century. ""I had this dance within me for a long time,"" Matisse once said in describing one of his murals. Dance Me to the End of Love is the perfect book for art lovers, song lovers, and all other lovers as well.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781932183931'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1932183930'}]",True,False,0,Art,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YllOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YllOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2006,Rizzoli Publications

QZEvv283TAkC,dance,No Way Home,A Dancer's Journey from the Streets of Havana to the Stages of the World,Carlos Acosta,"Carlos Acosta, the Cuban dancer considered to be one of the world's greatest performers, fearlessly depicts his journey from adolescent troublemaker to international superstar in his captivating memoir, No Way Home. Carlos was just another kid from the slums of Havana; the youngest son of a truck driver and a housewife, he ditched school with his friends and dreamed of becoming Cuba's best soccer player. Exasperated by his son's delinquent behavior, Carlos's father enrolled him in ballet school, subjecting him to grueling days that started at five thirty in the morning and ended long after sunset. The path from student to star was not an easy one. Even as he won dance competitions and wowed critics around the world, Carlos was homesick for Cuba, crippled by loneliness and self-doubt. As he traveled the world, Carlos struggled to overcome popular stereotypes and misconceptions; to maintain a relationship with his family; and, most of all, to find a place he could call home. This impassioned memoir is about more than Carlos's rise to stardom. It is about a young man forced to leave his homeland and loved ones for a life of self-discipline, displacement, and physical hardship. It is also about how the heart and soul of a country can touch the heart and soul of one of its citizens. With candor and humor, Carlos vividly depicts daily life in communist Cuba, his feelings about ballet -- an art form he both lovesand hates -- and his complex relationship with his father. Carlos Acosta makes dance look effortless, but the grace, strength, and charisma we see onstage have come at a cost.

XV8oWKp3H1gC,dance,Dancing Desires,Choreographing Sexualities on and Off the Stage,Jane Desmond,"What happens to the writing of dance history when issues of sexuality and sexual identity are made central? What happens to queer theory, and to other theoretical constructs of gender and sexuality, when a dancing body takes center stage? Dancing Desires asks these questions, exploring the relationship between dancing bodies and sexual identity on the concert stage, in nightclubs, in film, in the courts, and on the streets. From Nijinsky's balletic prowess to Charlie Chaplin's lightfooted ""Little Tramp,"" from lesbian go-go dancers to the swans of Swan Lake, from the postmodern works of Bill T. Jones to the dangers of same-sex social dancing at Disneyland and the ecstatic Mardi Gras dance parties of Sydney, Australia, this book tracks the intersections of dance and human sexuality in the twentieth century as the definition of each has shifted and expanded. The contributors come from a number of fields (literature, history, theater, dance, film studies, legal studies, critical race studies) and employ methodologies ranging from textual analysis and film theory to ethnography. By embracing dance, and bodily movement more generally, as a crucial focus for investigation, together they initiate a new agenda for tracking the historical kinesthetics of sexuality.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0299170543'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780299170547'}]",False,False,492,Art,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XV8oWKp3H1gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XV8oWKp3H1gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2001,秀和システム

In the 1970s, as the disco tsunami engulfed America, the question, “Do you wanna dance?” became divisive, even explosive. What was it about this music that made it such hot stuff? In this incisive history, Alice Echols reveals the ways in which disco, assumed to be shallow and disposable, permanently transformed popular music, propelling it into new sonic territory and influencing rap, techno, and trance. This account probes the complex relationship between disco and the era’s major movements: gay liberation, feminism, and African American rights. But it never loses sight of the era’s defining soundtrack, spotlighting the work of precursors James Brown and Isaac Hayes, its dazzling divas Donna Summer and the women of Labelle, and some of its lesser-known but no less illustrious performers like Sylvester. You’ll never say “disco sucks” again after reading this fascinating account of the music you thought you hated but can’t stop dancing to.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780393077018'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0393077012'}]",True,False,366,History,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DzrvOAA2tvAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DzrvOAA2tvAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1820.48,INR,1820.48,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DzrvOAA2tvAC&rdid=book-DzrvOAA2tvAC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2010,W.

1aWmDwAAQBAJ,dance,Raising Dust,A Cultural History of Dance in Palestine,Nicholas Rowe,"Dance in Palestine has a history as complex and contentious as the land itself. Whether dismissed as bacchantic madness by Bible tourists in the 19th Century, revived and glorified by Zionists, Pan-Arabists and Palestinian Nationalists in the 20th Century, or rejected by Islamic Reformists in the 21st Century, dance in Palestine has a rich and elusive story that remains to be told. 'Raising Dust' traces one dancer's journey into Palestine's past and present. Through historical archives, the memories of dancers of yesteryear and into today's vibrant performing arts scene, Nicholas Rowe shows how dance has acted as a barometer of social change, a forum for debate and a means of expressing forbidden ideas. Far from apolitical, this most physical of art forms has often defined the political mood of the day. Sumptuously illustrated, the author provides a unique, rare and compelling cultural history of dance in Palestine.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780857731210'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0857731211'}]",True,True,186,History,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1aWmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1aWmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,5176.0,INR,5176.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1aWmDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1aWmDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2010,Bloomsbury Publishing

Goodill shows how working creatively with the mind/body connection can encourage and enhance the healing process. This book represents the first attempt to compile, synthesize, and publish the work that has been done over recent years in medical DMT. The emerging application of medical DMT is grounded within the context of established viewpoints and theories, such as arts therapies, health psychology and scientific perspectives. As well as examining its theoretical foundations, the author offers real-life examples of medical DMT working with people of different ages with different medical conditions. This comprehensive book provides a firm foundation for exploration and practice in medical DMT, including recommendations for professional preparation, research and program development. Interviews with dance/movement therapists bring fresh and exciting perspectives to the field and these and the author's testimonies point to the possible future applications of medical DMT. With an increasing number of professional dance/movement therapists working with the medically ill and their families, this is a timely and well-grounded look at an exciting new discipline. It is recommended reading for DMT students and professionals, complementary therapists, and all those with an interest in the healing potential of working innovatively with the mind and body.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781843107859'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1843107856'}]",False,True,242,Health & Fitness,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rw4QBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rw4QBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2005,Jessica Kingsley Publishers

CYQZUeo0mcMC,dance,I Was a Dancer,A Memoir,Jacques D'Amboise,"“Who am I? I’m a man; an American, a father, a teacher, but most of all, I am a person who knows how the arts can change lives, because they transformed mine. I was a dancer.” In this rich, expansive, spirited memoir, Jacques d’Amboise, one of America’s most celebrated classical dancers, and former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet for more than three decades, tells the extraordinary story of his life in dance, and of America’s most renowned and admired dance companies. He writes of his classical studies beginning at the age of eight at The School of American Ballet. At twelve he was asked to perform with Ballet Society; three years later he joined the New York City Ballet and made his European debut at London’s Covent Garden. As George Balanchine’s protégé, d’Amboise had more works choreographed on him by “the supreme Ballet Master” than any other dancer, among them Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux; Episodes; A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream; Jewels; Raymonda Variations. He writes of his boyhood—born Joseph Ahearn—in Dedham, Massachusetts; his mother (“the Boss”) moving the family to New York City’s Washington Heights; dragging her son and daughter to ballet class (paying the teacher $7.50 from hats she made and sold on street corners, and with chickens she cooked stuffed with chestnuts); his mother changing the family name from Ahearn to her maiden name, d’Amboise (“It’s aristocratic. It has the ‘d’ apostrophe. It sounds better for the ballet, and it’s a better name”). We see him. a neighborhood tough, in Catholic schools being taught by the nuns; on the streets, fighting with neighborhood gangs, and taking ten classes a week at the School of American Ballet . . . being taught professional class by Balanchine and by other teachers of great legend: Anatole Oboukhoff, premier danseur of the Maryinsky; and Pierre Vladimiroff, Pavlova’s partner. D’Amboise writes about Balanchine’s succession of ballerina muses who inspired him to near-obsessive passion and led him to create extraordinary ballets, dancers with whom d’Amboise partnered—Maria Tallchief; Tanaquil LeClercq, a stick-skinny teenager who blossomed into an exquisite, witty, sophisticated “angel” with her “long limbs and dramatic, mysterious elegance . . .”; the iridescent Allegra Kent; Melissa Hayden; Suzanne Farrell, who Balanchine called his “alabaster princess,” her every fiber, every movement imbued with passion and energy; Kay Mazzo; Kyra Nichols (“She’s perfect,” Balanchine said. “Uncomplicated—like fresh water”); and Karin von Aroldingen, to whom Balanchine left most of his ballets. D’Amboise writes about dancing with and courting one of the company’s members, who became his wife for fifty-three years, and the four children they had . . . On going to Hollywood to make Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and being offered a long-term contract at MGM (“If you’re not careful,” Balanchine warned, “you will have sold your soul for seven years”) . . . On Jerome Robbins (“Jerry could be charming and complimentary, and then, five minutes later, attack, and crush your spirit—all to see how it would influence the dance movements”). D’Amboise writes of the moment when he realizes his dancing career is over and he begins a new life and new dream teaching children all over the world about the arts through the magic of dance. A riveting, magical book, as transformative as dancing itself.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307595232'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307595234'}]",True,False,465,Biography & Autobiography,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYQZUeo0mcMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYQZUeo0mcMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1290.22,INR,645.11,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CYQZUeo0mcMC&rdid=book-CYQZUeo0mcMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2011,Knopf

bbG1EAAAQBAJ,dance,"Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake",A Social and Popular Dance Reader,Julie Malnig,"This dynamic collection documents the rich and varied history of social dance and the multiple styles it has generated, while drawing on some of the most current forms of critical and theoretical inquiry. The essays cover different historical periods and styles; encompass regional influences from North and South America, Britain, Europe, and Africa; and emphasize a variety of methodological approaches, including ethnography, anthropology, gender studies, and critical race theory. While social dance is defined primarily as dance performed by the public in ballrooms, clubs, dance halls, and other meeting spots, contributors also examine social dance’s symbiotic relationship with popular, theatrical stage dance forms. Contributors are Elizabeth Aldrich, Barbara Cohen-Stratyner, Yvonne Daniel, Sherril Dodds, Lisa Doolittle, David F.

whTADwAAQBAJ,dance,Moving through Conflict,Dance and Politcs in Israel,"Dina Roginsky, Henia Rottenberg","Moving through Conflict: Dance and Politics in Israel is a pioneering project in examining the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through dance. It proposes a research framework for study of the social, cultural, aesthetic and political dynamics between Jews and Arabs as reflected in dance from late 19th-century Palestine to present-day Israel. Drawing on multiple disciplines, this book examines a variety of social and theatrical venues (communities, dance groups, evening classes and staged performances), dance genres (folk dancing, social dancing and theatrical dancing) and different cultural identities (Israeli, Palestinian and American). Underlying this work is a fundamental question: can the body and dance operate as nonverbal autonomous agents to mediate change in conflicting settings, transforming the ""foreign"" into the ""familiar""? Or are they bound to their culturally dependent significance – and thus nothing more than additional sites of an embodied politics? This anthology expounds on various studies on dance, historical periods, points of view and points of contact that help promote thinking about this fundamental issue. It will be of great interest to students and scholars of dance studies, sociology, anthropology, art history, education and cultural studies, as well as conflict and resolution studies.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000750478'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000750477'}]",True,True,285,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=whTADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=whTADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3535.28,INR,3535.28,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=whTADwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-whTADwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Routledge

fUMHEAAAQBAJ,dance,Identity and Diversity,Celebrating Dance in Taiwan,"Wang Yunyu, Stephanie Burridge","Reflecting the breadth and diversity of dance in the Asia–Pacific region, this volume provides an in-depth and comprehensive study of Taiwan’s dance history. Taiwan is home to several indigenous tribes with unique rituals and folk dance traditions, with an array of eclectic influences including martial arts and Peking Opera from China, and dance forms such as contemporary, neo-classical, post-modern, jazz, ballroom, and hip-hop from the West. Dance in Taiwan, led by pioneers such as choreographers Liu Feng-shueh and Lin Hwai-min, continues to have a strong presence in both performance and educational arenas. In 1973, Lin Hwai-min created Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, the country’s internationally acclaimed modern dance company, and simultaneously produced a generation of dancers not only trained in modern dance and ballet, but also in Chinese aesthetics and history, tai-chi and meditation. Including the voices of dance professionals, scholars and critics, this collection of articles highlights the emerging trends and challenges faced by dance in Taiwan. It examines the history, creative development, education, training, and above all, the hybrid practices that give Taiwanese dance a unique identity, making it central to the renaissance of Asian contemporary dance. In describing how the intersections of dance cultures are marked by exchanges, research and pedagogy, it shows the way choreographers, performers, associated artists and companies of the region choose to imaginatively invent, blend, fuse, select and morph the multiple influences, revitalising and preserving cultural heritage while oscillating between tradition and change.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000084399'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000084396'}]",True,True,216,History,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fUMHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fUMHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3138.8,INR,3138.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fUMHEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-fUMHEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020,Taylor & Francis

0XsnAAAAMAAJ,dance,Jazz Dance,The Story of American Vernacular Dance,"Marshall Winslow Stearns, Jean Stearns","In Jazz Dance, Marshall and Jean Stearns have created a vibrant, authoritative record of this thoroughly American contribution to the world of dance and music. Drawing upon years of close involvement with jazz in America, they have traced, studied, and organized a history so rich and complex that it is unique in the literature of dance. Their remarkable enthusiasm and depth of scholarship have produced a book that, like Marshall Stearns's The Story of Jazz, should become the definitive work in its field. Most of the material in Jazz Dance is taken from more than two hundred interviews with dancers, musicians, choreographers, and observers of jazz. Jazz dance, like jazz itself, has its origins in Africa, and was brought to the West Indies and southern United States by slaves. In the West Indies, African dance took on some new characteristics; in New Orleans it was influenced by European tradition; in more remote areas it remained relatively unchanged, and is distinctly traceable to its sources today. The history of American jazz dance is uniquely linked to the evolution of jazz music, the status of the Negro in American society, the economics of show business, and the volatile music industry. It has its rival factions, its colorful heroes, its legends, its fashions, and its trends. It evolved from slave folk dances through the early minstrel shows to Harlem, Tin Pan Alley, and Broadway. Passed from the folk to the professionals - great dancers like Williams and Walker, King Rastus Brown, Bill Robinson, Coles and Atkins, Fred Astaire, and John W. Bubbles - jazz dance took hold of the country. In each generation the people and the professionals danced to jazz. They danced the Cakewalk, the Charleston, the Lindy Hop, the Shimmy, and the Twist; they tapped, stomped, shuffled, and glided through the Soft Shoe. And, though times change and fads vanish, people are still dancing - to jazz. Some of the best documentation on the history of jazz dance is visual, and for this reason two important appendices are included here. One is an exhaustive list of films - documentaries, television productions, and full-length motion pictures - compiled by Ernest Smith, an expert in this field, in which jazz dance may be seen. The other is analysis, in labanotation, of basic African, popular American, and jazz dance movements, charting their striking similarities as well as their less obvious differences. This work has been contributed by Nadia Chilkovsky Nahumck, the noted dancer and teacher, currently a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania and the Director of the Philadelphia Academy of Dance. In addition to these appendices, the book includes many valuable photographs, some from private collections, of great American jazz dancers in performance.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'UOM:39015011541805'}]",False,False,506,African American dance,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0XsnAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0XsnAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,1968,New York : Macmillan

In examining the basic elements of dance - the Alphabet of Movement - and using illustrations of movement technique and notation symbols it provides a new way to see, to teach and to choreograph dance. This book gives a list of primary actions upon which all physical activity is gased, focusing on both the functional and expressive sides of movement. It draws upon the author's broad experience in ballet, modern and ethnic dance to reinterpret movement and to shed new light on the role of movement in dance. Your Move is an important book not only for dancers but also for instructors in sport and physical therapy. Each copy of Your Move comes complete with exercise sheets, which can also be purchased separately. A teacher's guide has also been designed providing notes on each chapter, approaches to the exploration of movement, interpretation of the reading studies, additional information of motif description and answers to the exercise sheets. An optional audio cassette, with music written and recorded especially for use with the book, is also available.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781135073275'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1135073279'}]",True,True,350,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_eBwGX1nu5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_eBwGX1nu5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,5491.72,INR,5491.72,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_eBwGX1nu5cC&rdid=book-_eBwGX1nu5cC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013,Routledge

NmxyxQEACAAJ,dance,Lighting Dance,"A Study of Technical, Philosophical, and Psychological Shadows",Flaviana Xavier Antunes Sampaio,"Lighting Dance pioneers the discussion of the ability of lighting design to foreground shadow in dance performances. Through a series of experiments integrating light, shadow, and improvised dance movement, it highlights and analyses what it advances as an innovative expression of shadow in dance as an alternative to more conventional approaches to lighting design. Different art forms, such as painting, film, and dance pieces from Loie Fuller, the Russell Maliphant Dance Company, Elevenplay, Pilobolus, and the Tao Dance Theater served to inspire and contextualise the study. From lighting to psychology, from reviews to academic books, shadows are examined as a symbolic and manipulative entity. The book also presents the dance solo Sombreiro, which was created to echo the experiments with light, shadow, and movement aligned to an interpretation of cultural shadow (Jung 1954, in Samuels, Shorter, and Plaut 1986; Casement 2006; Ramos 2004; Stein 2004; and others). The historical development of lighting within dance practices is also outlined, providing a valuable resource for lighting designers, dance practitioners, and theatre goers interested in the visuality of dance performances.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0367219174'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780367219178'}]",False,False,248,Dance,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmxyxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmxyxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,Unknown Publisher

So begins the tale of Kate Crane, a soloist in a celebrated New York City ballet company who is struggling to keep her place in a very demanding world. At every turn she is haunted by her close relationship with her younger sister, Gwen, a fellow company dancer whose career quickly surpassed Kate’s, but who has recently suffered a breakdown and returned home. Alone for the first time in her life, Kate is anxious and full of guilt about the role she may have played in her sister’s collapse. As we follow her on an insider tour of rehearsals, performances, and partners onstage and off, she confronts the tangle of love, jealousy, pride, and obsession that are beginning to fracture her own sanity. Funny, dark, intimate, and unflinchingly honest, The Cranes Dance is a book that pulls back the curtains to reveal the private lives of dancers and explores the complicated bond between sisters.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307949820'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307949826'}]",False,False,386,Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6d88Of7fwgwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6d88Of7fwgwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2012,Vintage

6QTaDwAAQBAJ,dance,Contemporary African Dance Theatre,"Phenomenology, Whiteness, and the Gaze",Sabine Sörgel,"This book is the first to consider contemporary African dance theatre aesthetics in the context of phenomenology, whiteness, and the gaze. Rather than a discussion of African dance per se, the author challenges hegemonic perceptions of contemporary African dance theatre to interrogate the extent to which white supremacy and privilege weave through capitalist necropolitics and determine our perception of contemporary African dance theatre today. Multiple aesthetic strategies are discussed throughout the book to account for the affective experience of ‘un-suturing’ that touches white spectatorship and colonial guilt at their core. The critical analysis covers a broad range of dance choreography by artists from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Canada, Europe, and the US as they travel, create, and show their works internationally to global audiences to contest racial divides and white supremacist politics.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783030415013'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3030415015'}]",True,True,178,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6QTaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6QTaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,6726.0,INR,6726.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6QTaDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-6QTaDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020,Springer Nature

Azy2QgAACAAJ,dance,The Anthropology of Dance,No Subtitle,Anya Peterson Royce,"""Dance is a powerful, frequently adopted symbol of the way people feel about themselves. "" So concludes the author of this pioneering book, the first general introduction to the anthropology of dance. Since anthropology has broadened its horizons to include Western, industrialized, and urban societies, the study of dance culture may, with equal legitimacy, observe ballet, the Hawaiian hula, the classical tradition of Bharata Natyam, the pigeon wings and polkas of the California gold rush miners, and the minuets of colonial Virginaia planters. Dance makes its unique contribution to society and culture by virtue of its form and expression; at the same time it is intimately bound up with the elements of religion, kinship and social organization, politics, and economics. The fact that dance is inseparable from its means of expression-the human body making patterns in time and space-means that it cannot be divorced from its social and cultural context. The author first explores the various meanings that dance has had over time for different peoples. Next she focuses on the place that dance has occupied in anthropological studies over the past one hundred years. Techniques for studying and recording dance are discussed, including notation systems, field guides, film, and anthropological means of participant- observation. The book then turns to structural and functional analyses, comparing them with reference to their different purposes and capabilities. Part Two presents three perspectives frequently used by anthropologists to view dance: the historical, the comparative, and the symbolic. Extended and fascinating case studies based on the author's research illustrate each of these perspectives: American colonial dance, North American Indian urban powwow dancing, and Zapotec dance of the Mexican isthmus. Part Three discusses two categories of research that will be significant in the future but which have not yet been carefully explored. They are creativity and aesthetics, on the one hand, and communication and meaning, on the other. The author concludes by pointing to some fruitful directions for future research in dance anthropology. ANYA PETERSON ROYCE is Chancellor's Professor of Anthropology and Comparative Literature at Indiana University. She is the author of The Anthropology of Dance; Ethnic Identity: Strategies of Diversity; Movement and Meaning: Creativity and Interpretation in Ballet and Mime, and the forthcoming Anthropology of the Performing Arts: Artistry, Virtuosity, and Interpretation in a Cross-Cultural Perspective. Her former career in classical ballet and her thirty-five years of ethnographic research give her a unique perspective and authority with which to speak about the performing arts as ritual and as theatre.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1852730889'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781852730888'}]",False,False,0,Dance,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Azy2QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Azy2QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2002,Dance Books Limited

xw6yaffdc5gC,dance,Glamour Addiction,Inside the American Ballroom Dance Industry,Juliet McMains,"In the wake of the blockbuster television success of “Dancing with the Stars,” competitive ballroom dance has become a subject of new fascination—and renewed scrutiny. Known by its practitioners as DanceSport, ballroom is a significant dance form and a fascinating cultural phenomenon. In this first in-depth study of the sport, dancer and dance historian Juliet McMains explores the “Glamour Machine” that drives the thriving industry, delving into both the pleasures and perils of its seductions. She further explores the broader social issues invoked in American DanceSport: representation of “Latin,” economics that often foster inequality, and issues of identity, including gender, race, class, and sexuality. Putting ballroom dance in the larger contexts of culture and history, Glamour Addiction makes an important contribution to dance studies, while giving new and veteran enthusiasts a unique and unprecedented glimpse behind the scenes.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0819567744'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780819567741'}]",False,False,268,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xw6yaffdc5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xw6yaffdc5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",3,2.5,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2006,Wesleyan

It is time to challenge and change how we train tomorrow's professional dancers. This book brings you the reasons why and all tools to implement change. 10 years ago, Matthew Wyon and Gaby Allard introduced a new pedagogical approach to training vocational dancers: Periodization. This ground-breaking new methodology provides an adaptable framework to optimise training - it's goal-focused, fits to performance schedules, and is highly sustainable for the dancer. It is the future. For the first time, Wyon and Allard have put their discoveries to paper. Periodization provides clear context to why change is needed, and explores the theoretical underpinnings of this new approach and how it can be effectively applied to a dance environment.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781350194519'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1350194514'}]",False,False,257,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eO5NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eO5NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2022,Bloomsbury Publishing

un-XtgEACAAJ,dance,"Risk, Failure, Play",What Dance Reveals about Martial Arts Training,Janet O'Shea,"Decried as mere brutality on display and celebrated as viscerally real, combat sport has escaped nuanced reflection. Risk, Failure, Play illuminates the many ways in which competitive martial arts differentiate themselves from violence. Presented from the perspective of a dancer and writer, this book takes readers through the examination of the politics of everyday life as experienced through training in a range of martial arts practices such as jeet kune do, Brazilian jiu jitsu, kickboxing, Filipino martial arts, and empowerment self defense. The book suggests that play gives us the ability to manage difficult realities with intelligence and that physical play, with its immediacy and its heightened risk, is particularly effective at accomplishing this task. Despite its association with frivolity and ease, play is not the opposite of danger, rigor, or failure. Indeed, Risk, Failure, Play demonstrates the many ways in which physical recreation allows us to manage the complexities of our current social reality. Risk, Failure, Play intertwines personal experience with phenomenology, social psychology, dance studies, performance studies, as well as theories of play and competition in order to produce insights on pleasure, mastery, vulnerability, pain, agency, individual identity, and society. Ultimately, this book suggests that play allows us to rehearse other ways to live than the ones we see before us and challenges us to reimagine our social reality. The book will be of interest to martial artists and martial arts scholars, dancers and dance researchers, sports studies scholars, cultural theorists and philosophers of everyday life and sports administrators.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0190871547'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780190871543'}]",False,False,248,Music,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=un-XtgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=un-XtgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2018,"Oxford University Press, USA"

Ph.D.,"Three dancers who changed the face of Modern Dance and liberated dancers from ballet’s rigidity to glorify the human body as a scared vessel: Isadora Duncan, 1877-1927, Ruth St. Denis, 1879-1968, and Martha Graham, 1894-1991. From youth, each recognized an organic urge for ecstatic human expression.

uZ6ZBgAAQBAJ,dance,"My Story, My Dance",Robert Battle's Journey to Alvin Ailey,Lesa Cline-Ransome,"“In James E. Ransome’s realistic pastel portraits, Battle, his family, and his teachers all seem lit from within.” —The New York Times Book Review A boy discovers his passion for dance and becomes a modern hero in this inspiring picture book biography of Robert Battle, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. When Robert Battle was a boy wearing leg braces, he never dreamed he’d study at Juilliard. Though most dancers begin training at an early age, it wasn’t until Robert was a teenager that his appreciation for movement—first from martial arts, then for ballet—became his passion. But support from his family and teachers paired with his desire and determination made it possible for Robert to excel. After years of hard work, the young man who was so inspired by a performance of Alvin Ailey’s Revelations became the artistic director of the very company that motivated him. Today, under Robert’s leadership, Alvin Ailey continues to represent the African American spirit through dance. Featuring illustrations brimming with vibrant color and swirling motion, this biographical picture book from husband-and-wife team James Ransome and Lisa Cline-Ransome includes a foreword from Robert Battle himself as well as a bibliography, suggested further reading, and an author’s note.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781481422222'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1481422227'}]",True,True,48,Juvenile Nonfiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uZ6ZBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uZ6ZBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,739.86,INR,369.93,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uZ6ZBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-uZ6ZBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2015,Simon and Schuster

C6AyEAAAQBAJ,dance,FALLING Through Dance and Life,No Subtitle,Emilyn Claid,"This is a book about falling as a means of reconfiguring our relationship with living and dying. Dancer, choreographer, educator and therapist, Emilyn Claid, draws inspiration from her personal and professional experiences to explore alternative approaches to being present in the world. Contemporary movement based performers ground their practices in understanding the interplay of gravity and the body. Somatic intentional falling provides them a creative resource for developing both self and environmental support. The physical, metaphorical and psychological impact of these practices informs the theories and perspectives presented in this book. As falling can be dangerous and painful, encouraging people to do so willingly might be considered a provocative premise. Western culture generally resists falling because it provokes fear and represents failure. Out of this tension a paradox emerges: falling, we are both powerless subjects and agents of change, a dynamic distinction that enlivens discussions throughout the writing. Emilyn engages with different dance genres, live performance and therapeutic interactions to form her ideas and interlaces her arguments with issues of gender and race. She describes how surrender to gravity can transform our perceptions and facilitate ways of being that are relational and life enhancing. Woven throughout, autobiographical, poetic, philosophical, descriptive and theoretical voices combine to question the fixation of Western culture on uprightness and supremacy. A simple act of falling builds momentum through eclectic discussions, uncovering connections to shame, laughter, trauma, ageing and the thrill of release.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781350075719'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '135007571X'}]",False,False,225,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C6AyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C6AyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2021,Bloomsbury Publishing

O71n2il6ANoC,dance,Dancing Women,Female Bodies on Stage,Sally Banes,"Dancing Women: Female Bodies Onstage is a spectacular and timely contribution to dance history, recasting canonical dance since the early nineteenth century in terms of a feminist perspective. Setting the creation of specific dances in socio-political and cultural contexts, Sally Banes shows that choreographers have created representations of women that are shaped by - and that in part shape - society's continuing debates about sexuality and female identity. Broad in its scope and compelling in its argument Dancing Women: * provides a series of re-readings of the canon, from Romantic and Russian Imperial ballet to contemporary ballet and modern dance * investigates the gaps between plot and performance that create sexual and gendered meanings * examines how women's agency is created in dance through aspects of choreographic structure and style * analyzes a range of women's images - including brides, mistresses, mothers, sisters, witches, wraiths, enchanted princesses, peasants, revolutionaries, cowgirls, scientists, and athletes - as well as the creation of various women's communities on the dance stage * suggests approaches to issues of gender in postmodern dance Using an interpretive strategy different from that of other feminist dance historians, who have stressed either victimization or celebration of women, Banes finds a much more complex range of cultural representations of gender identities.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0415096715'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780415096713'}]",False,True,298,Art,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O71n2il6ANoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O71n2il6ANoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,1998,Psychology Press

Uh6UnQEACAAJ,dance,Performance and Ethnography,"Dance, Drama, Music","Peter Harrop, Dunja Njaradi","Performance and Ethnography: Dance, Drama, Music revisits the territory of the performance orientation, touching on anthropology, dance, folklore, music and theatre to look for present trends in both the ethnography of performance and performance ethnography. One of the main concerns of this volume is with an embodied, affective and sensory ethnography that privileges encounters between ethnographer, participants and practices as key to understanding and knowledge. Another is the extent to which individuals are shaped by their engagement with ethnographic practice in the midst of migration, diffusion, revival, appropriation and commodification of performance. A third is the interface of academic disciplines with the idea of performance, and the way in which academics and practitioners are drawn to ethnography to better understand, negotiate, perform and profess their diverse fields. Individual chapters include a refreshed interface for performance studies and anthropology through new approaches to ritual; a consideration of performance studies through an ethnography of PSi; the emplaced body as a tool for ethnographic research; somatic practice in dance as a mode of ethnography; artisanal musical instrument making as performance; the commodification of traditional performance; and an introductory overview that reflects shifting ethnographic perspectives on traditional performances.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1443847615'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781443847612'}]",False,False,0,Dance,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uh6UnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uh6UnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2013,Cambridge Scholars Publishing

PmlnzgEACAAJ,dance,"Dance, Music and Cultures of Decolonisation in the Indian Diaspora",No Subtitle,Taylor & Francis Group,"Dance, Music and Cultures of Decolonisation in the Indian Diaspora provides fascinating examples of dance and music projects across the Indian Diaspora to highlight that decolonisation is a creative process, as well as a historical and political one. The book analyses creative processes in decolonising projects, illustrating how dance and music across the Indian Diaspora articulate socio-political aspirations in the wake of thinkers such as Gandhi and Ambedkar. It presents a wide range of examples: post-apartheid practices and experiences in a South African dance company, contestations over national identity politics in Trinidadian music competitions, essentialist and assimilationist strategies in a British dance competition, the new musical creativity of second-generation British-Tamil performers, Indian classical dance projects of reform and British multiculturalism, feminist intercultural performances in Australia, and performance re-enactments of museum exhibits that critically examine the past. Key topics under discussion include postcolonial contestations, decolonising scholarship, dialogic pedagogies and intellectual responsibility. The book critically reflects on decolonising aims around respect, equality and the colonial past's redress as expressed through performing arts projects. Presenting richly detailed case studies that underline the need to examine creative processes in the cultures of decolonisation, Dance, Music and Cultures of Decolonisation in the Indian Diaspora will be of great interest to scholars of South Asian Studies, Diaspora Studies, Performing Arts Studies and Anthropology.

A recent invention, the personal computer, was quickly altering the nature of the workplace and reducing the need for jobs and workers to fill them. The runaway inflation of the 1970s was gradually being reined in, but the good news came at a price. As the government vowed to cut back on spending, companies went out of business at a record rate, the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

yraL-_IrP-AC,dance,Naked Lives,Inside the Worlds of Exotic Dance,Mindy S. Bradley-Engen,"Is stripping good or bad for the women who do it? According to sociologist Mindy S. Bradley-Engen, there's no simple answer. An exotic dancer's experiences can be both empowering and degrading: at times a dancer can feel like a goddess, at times ashamed and dirty. Drawing on extensive interviews as well as her own experiences as an exotic dancer, Bradley-Engen shows that strippers' work experiences are shaped by the types of establishments—the different worlds—in which they work. A typology of strip clubs emerges: the hustle club, the show club, and the social club, each with its own distinct culture, expectations, and challenges, each creating circumstances in which stripping can be good, bad, or indifferent. Going beyond the warring rhetorics of exploitation and empowerment, this book provides a rich and complex account of the realities of exotic dance and offers a fascinating, thought-provoking consideration for both academics and general readers.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781438426327'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1438426321'}]",False,True,149,Social Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yraL-_IrP-AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yraL-_IrP-AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1714.2,INR,1714.2,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yraL-_IrP-AC&rdid=book-yraL-_IrP-AC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2012,State University of New York Press

It describes the rise of modern ballroom dancing as Britain's predominant popular style, as well as the opening of hundreds of affordable dancing schools and purpose-built dance halls. It focuses in particular on the relationship between the dance profession and dance hall industry and the consumers who formed the dancing public. Together these groups negotiated the creation of a 'national' dancing style, which constructed, circulated, and commodified ideas about national identity. At the same time, the book emphasizes the global, exploring the impact of international cultural products on national identity construction, the complexities of Americanisation, and Britain's place in a transnational system of production and consumption that forged the dances of the Jazz Age.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1784994332'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781784994334'}]",False,False,287,Dance,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmjMyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmjMyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2017,Studies in Popular Culture

uRDTmAEACAAJ,dance,The Wicked Waltz and Other Scandalous Dances,Outrage at Couple Dancing in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries,Mark Knowles,"The waltz, perhaps the most beloved social dance of the 19th and early 20th centuries, provoked outrage from religious leaders and other self-appointed arbiters of social morality. Decrying the corrupting influence of social dancing on decency and health, they failed to suppress the popularity of the waltz or other dance crazes of the period, such as the Charleston, the Tango, and Ragtime dances such as the Turkey Trot, Grizzly Bear, and Bunny Hug. This book investigates the development and importance of these popular dances with particular attention to the waltz, evaluating in particular how their very existence as ""taboo"" cultural fads led to initial outrage while ultimately providing a catalyst for lasting social reform. Focusing on couple dances of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it reveals how they expressed this tumultuous period and the shifting social attitudes of the day. In addition to examining the impact of the waltz craze on fashion, music, leisure, and social reform, the text describes the opposition to the dance and the proliferation of both anti-dance and courtesy literature. It then explores these same issues as they relate to other dance crazes of the early 1900s.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0786437081'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780786437085'}]",False,False,262,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uRDTmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uRDTmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2009,McFarland Publishing
JgFQzAEACAAJ,dance,Musicology and Dance,Historical and Critical Perspectives,"Davinia Caddy, Maribeth Clark","Long treated as peripheral to music history, dance has become prominent within musicological research, as a prime and popular subject for an increasing number of books, articles, conference papers and special symposiums. Despite this growing interest, there remains no thorough-going critical examination of the ways in which musicologists might engage with dance, thinking not only about specific repertoires or genres, but about fundamental commonalities between the two, including embodiment, agency, subjectivity and consciousness. This volume begins to fill this gap. Ten chapters illustrate a range of conceptual, historical and interpretive approaches that advance the interdisciplinary study of music and dance. This methodological eclecticism is a defining feature of the volume, integrating insights from critical theory, film and cultural studies, the visual arts, phenomenology, cultural anthropology and literary criticism into the study of music and dance.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '110847618X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781108476188'}]",False,False,320,Music,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JgFQzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JgFQzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,Cambridge University Press

0kcUAQAAIAAJ,dance,Nijinsky's Bloomsbury Ballet,Reconstruction of Dance and Design for Jeux,Millicent Hodson,"Vaslav Nijinsky's Jeux, to a commissioned score by Claude Debussy, is a daring dance poem about the libertine manners and mores of the Bloomsbury artists he and designer Leon Bakst observed at a nocturnal tennis party in London's Bedford Square. The ambiguous coupling and tripling Nijinsky explored in Jeux startled the public, as did Debussy's music, in which both the tango and turkey trot, as well as pleasure-garden themes inspired by Wagner's Parsifal are quoted. Critics attacked not so much the ethics of the ballet as its post-impressionist aesthetics, influenced by the French painters that Bloomsbury had revealed to England since 1910. Despite contemporary references, athletic moves and pure spatial geometry, Jeux disarmed spectators in 1913 because it still looked like a ballet. Nijinsky had discovered neoclassicism in dance. In 1996 Millicent Hodson, choreographer and graphic artist, together with Kenneth Archer, scenic consultant and art historian, premiered the reconstructed Jeux in Verona at the Teatro Filarmonico. During the spring 2000 restaging in London at the Royal Ballet, Covent Garden, Hodson completed the reconstruction dance score.Nijinsky's Bloomsbury Ballet presents the dance score with its verbal and visual documentation of the period, as well as Hodson's choreographic drawings and text collated with music. Archer contributes an essay on Bakst's costumes and décor. The book is a companion volume to Hodson's reconstruction score for Le Sacre du Printemps, Nijinsky's Crime Against Grace, published by Pendragon Press in 1996.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'STANFORD:36105131648078'}]",False,False,324,Biography & Autobiography,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0kcUAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0kcUAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2008,Unknown Publisher

The contributors confront basic questions of definition and interpretation within dance studies, while at the same time examining broader issues, such as the body, gender, class, race, nationalism and cross-cultural exchange. Specific essays address such topics as the black male body in dance, gender and subversions in the dances of Mark Morris, race and nationalism in Martha Graham's American Document, and the history of oriental dance.

An accomplished ballerina, her desire to dance more expressively and with a partner led her on the path that culminated on the competition ballroom circuit. There, her passion and artistry led her to become a four-time champion in exhibition style. But, as with all obsessions, her success came with a cost. In this spellbinding book, Savoy offers a backstage pass to a world where rhinestones and high heels accompany explosive athleticism and staggering talent. With emotionally absorbing and energy-packed prose, she provides an insider's close-up view of all the players who compose this glamorous world that is part dance, part sport, and part art.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780813040837'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0813040833'}]",True,True,202,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A33SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A33SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2010,University Press of Florida
KWVgtAEACAAJ,dance,Moving Sites,Investigating Site-specific Dance Performance,Victoria Hunter,"Moving Sitesexplores site-specific dance practice through a combination of analytical essays and practitioner accounts of their working processes. In offering this joint effort of theory and practice, it aims to provide dance academics, students and practitioners with a series of discussions that shed light both on approaches to making this type of dance practice, and evaluating and reflecting on it. The edited volume combines critical thinking from a range of perspectives including commentary and observation from the fields of dance studies, human geography and spatial theory in order to present interdisciplinary discourse and a range of critical and practice-led lenses through which this type of work can be considered and explored. In so doing, this book addresses the following questions: � How do choreographers make site-specific dance performance? � What occurs when a moving body engages with site, place and environment? � How might we interpret, analyse and evaluate this type of dance practice through a range of theoretical lenses? � How can this type of practice inform wider discussions of embodiment, site, space, place and environment? This innovative and exciting book seeks to move beyond description and discussion of site-specific dance as a spectacle or novelty and considers site-dance as a valid and vital form of contemporary dance practice that explores, reflects, disrupts, contests and develops understandings and practices of inhabiting and engaging with a range of sites and environments. Dr Victoria Hunter is Senior Lecturer in Dance at the University of Chichester.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1315724952'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781315724959'}]",False,False,494,Art,en,Unknown,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2015,Unknown Publisher

USvsDwAAQBAJ,dance,The Fascist Turn in the Dance of Serge Lifar,Interwar French Ballet and the German Occupation,Mark Franko,"Ukrainian dancer and choreographer Serge Lifar (1905-86) is recognized both as the modernizer of French ballet in the twentieth century and as the keeper of the flame of the classical tradition upon which the glory of French ballet was founded. Having migrated to France from Russia in 1923 to join Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Lifar was appointed star dancer and ballet director at the Paris Opéra in 1930. Despite being rather unpopular with the French press at the start of his appointment, Lifar came to dominate the Parisian dance scene-through his publications as well as his dancing and choreography-until the end of the Second World War, reaching the height of his fame under the German occupation of Paris (1940-44). Rumors of his collaborationism having remained inconclusive throughout the postwar era, Lifar retired in 1958. This book not only reassesses Lifar's career, both aesthetically and politically, but also provides a broader reevaluation of the situation of dance-specifically balletic neoclassicism-in the first half of the twentieth century. The Fascist Turn in the Dance of Serge Lifar is the first book not only to discuss the resistance to Lifar in the French press at the start of his much-mythologized career, but also the first to present substantial evidence of Lifar's collaborationism and relate it to his artistic profile during the preceding decade. In examining the political significance of the critical discussion of Lifar's body and technique, author Mark Franko provides the ground upon which to understand the narcissistic and heroic images of Lifar in the 1930s as prefiguring the role he would play in the occupation. Through extensive archival research into unpublished documents of the era, police reports, the transcript of his postwar trial and rarely cited newspaper columns Lifar wrote, Franko reconstructs the dancer's political activities, political convictions, and political ambitions during the Occupation.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780197503348'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0197503349'}]",False,True,297,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=USvsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=USvsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,728.43,INR,364.22,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=USvsDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-USvsDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020,Oxford University Press

LNumDwAAQBAJ,dance,Confronting Orientalism,A Self-Study of Educating through Hindu Dance,Unknown Author,"The author aims to use Kuchipudi Indian classical Hindu dance to educate non-Hindus about Hinduism with postcolonialism in mind. This goal arises from her dance experiences and the historical era of imperialism. Colonization occurs when those in power believe there is a need to dominate in a manner that subjugates people. Colonizers created colonies as they moved into territory because they felt there was a need to “civilize” the so-called savages of the land. Postcolonialism is an intellectual discourse that confronts the legacy of colonialism and attempts to de-colonize. With the legacy of colonialism and a postcolonial lens in mind, some research questions arise. How does she, as a Kuchipudi dancer, use Hindu dance to educate non-Hindus about the Eastern literature of Hinduism? For non-Hindus, she feels the power of the exoticizing gaze when she dances, which might very well block the educational intention of the dance. This exoticizing gaze prevents the understanding of the traditional nature of the dance and the introduction to Hinduism as a world religion. The author’s problem is moving the exotic gaze of non-Hindus to an educational gaze that seeks to learn about the ethics of Hinduism in a manner that takes into consideration the multiple perspectives of the complex society we live in today. “In short, MisirHiralall’s research highlights the role of contemplation and critical-self reflection in creating opportunities for true intercultural relations that respect the epistemologies of traditionally marginalized and stigmatized non-Western religions and cultures. This is essential theoretical and practical research for a multicultural society that is grounded in first-person, lived experience.” – Tyson E. Lewis, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Art Education, University of North Texas “Most impressive is that MisirHiralall is walking her talk through a thoughtful and lyrical self-study that is situated in the in-between: between the mind and body, the gaze of the Other and the self, the Eastern and Western worlds, and the fields of dance, religion, philosophy, cultural studies, and teacher education.” – Monica Taylor, Ph.D., Professor and Deputy Chair of the Department of Secondary and Special Education, Montclair State University “In MisirHiralall’s Confronting Orientalism, the reader is gifted with a rare glimpse into a philosopher-educator’s wrestling with her teaching through the medium of Hindu dance .... All who think seriously about the context and impact of their teaching in connection with their core values can benefit from reading of this book.” – Michael D.

It honours the remarkable commitment of the few remaining masters of the art of dance who are reviving and preserving the famous classical dances, as well as the courage and resolution of young artists who are imaginatively pursuing their passion to forge new paths in contemporary dance. n 2003, Cambodian classical dance was awarded world heritage status by UNESCO – this confirmed the importance, and perhaps the burden, of the task of preservation. This volume includes contributions from the royal family, eminent writers and commentators and the dancers themselves. Monuments and reminders of the Killing Fields abound in the city of Phnom Penh. Nearly 2 million Cambodians, including many artists, perished during the killings or died of starvation and disease during the Khmer Rouge years. Today, the dancers, both young and old, move towards the future while respecting and honouring the past.

pVOltGnhiuEC,dance,Dance,Rituals of Experience,Jamake Highwater,"This book presents a powerful view of the history of dance, contrasting its role in Western civilization with its significance in other cultures. Highwater--a renowned critic, author, and lecturer on art, theater, music, and dance--links the history of dance to cultural forces as diverse as Karl Marx and Elvis Presley. Beginning with the original, ritualistic, and primal forms of dance, he traces its decline into empty ceremonial forms while all along insisting that dance is a fundamental life impulse made visible in motion--a spontaneous transformation of experience into metaphoric meaning. Considering the historical and creative context from which dance emerged, Highwater goes on to point out the specific contributions and cultural influences of such 20th-century dance giants as Isadora Duncan, Twyla Tharp, Robert Wilson, George Balanchine, Martha Graham, Alwin Nikolais, Erick Hawkins, Jose Limon, Merce Cunningham, Meredith Monk, and Garth Fagan.

Zakkai addresses the challenges of engaging students in full-bodied motion in the classroom. She focuses first on helping students become responsible movers in the space, then offers structured learning experiences that demand a high level of concentration and creativity. Through verbal prompts--not demonstrations--that involve students in creative problem-solving, students learn through discovery instead of imitation. You don't have to be a dancer to use the detailed model lessons that guide you through warm-ups, movement explorations, rich curricular integrations, culminating activities, observation and reflection. To help your students understand curriculum content, express themselves in creative ways, and learn about dance as an art form, Dance as a Way of Knowing offers a progression of strategies that will make this vibrant discipline come alive in your classroom.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'STANFORD:36105028935851'}]",False,False,156,Education,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oOkkAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oOkkAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,1997,Unknown Publisher

F5isBwAAQBAJ,dance,Moving Sites,Investigating Site-Specific Dance Performance,Victoria Hunter,"Moving Sites explores site-specific dance practice through a combination of analytical essays and practitioner accounts of their working processes. In offering this joint effort of theory and practice, it aims to provide dance academics, students and practitioners with a series of discussions that shed light both on approaches to making this type of dance practice, and evaluating and reflecting on it. The edited volume combines critical thinking from a range of perspectives including commentary and observation from the fields of dance studies, human geography and spatial theory in order to present interdisciplinary discourse and a range of critical and practice-led lenses through which this type of work can be considered and explored. In so doing, this book addresses the following questions: · How do choreographers make site-specific dance performance? · What occurs when a moving body engages with site, place and environment? · How might we interpret, analyse and evaluate this type of dance practice through a range of theoretical lenses? · How can this type of practice inform wider discussions of embodiment, site, space, place and environment? This innovative and exciting book seeks to move beyond description and discussion of site-specific dance as a spectacle or novelty and considers site-dance as a valid and vital form of contemporary dance practice that explores, reflects, disrupts, contests and develops understandings and practices of inhabiting and engaging with a range of sites and environments.

Throughout it all, they shared a bond more intimate than any other in Prince's life.

8RcQEAAAQBAJ,dance,Lost to the World,"A Memoir of Faith, Family, and Five Years in Terrorist Captivity",Shahbaz Taseer,"Shahbaz Taseer’s memoir of his five-year-long captivity at the hands of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. In late August 2011, Shahbaz Taseer was dragged from his car at gunpoint and kidnapped by members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), a Talibanaffiliated Uzbek terrorist group. Taseer’s father, the governor of Punjab, Pakistan, had recently been assassinated for speaking in support of a Christian woman who had been accused of blasphemy and sentenced to death. Though Taseer himself wasn’t involved in politics, he was still a public figure who represented a more tolerant, internationally connected Pakistan that the IMU condemned. What followed his kidnapping was nearly five years of torture and constant peril as Taseer was held captive by the IMU in the ungoverned reaches of Pakistan and Afghanistan, his fate subject to the unpredictable whims and machinations of terrorists. Lost to the World is his memoir of that time—a story of extraordinary sorrow but also of empathy and faith. While deeply harrowing, this tale is also about resilience. Taseer countered his captors’ narrative of a holy war by immersing himself in the Quran in search of hope and a means to see his own humanity under even the most inhumane conditions, and ultimately to find a way back to his family.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780374718176'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0374718172'}]",True,False,215,Political Science,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8RcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8RcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2022,MCD

From bitter poverty to the stardom of the West - this is the extraordinary true story of one boy's great courage and determination. In a small, desperately poor village in north-east China, a young peasant boy sits at his rickety old school desk, more interested in the birds outside than in Chairman Mao's Red Book and the grand words it contains. But that day, some strange men come to his school - Madame Mao's cultural delegates. They are looking for young peasants to mould into faithful guards of Chairman Mao's great vision for China. This is the true story of how that one moment in time, by the thinnest thread of a chance, changed the course of a small boy's life in ways that are beyond description. One day he would dance with some of the greatest ballet companies of the world. One day he would be a friend to a president and first lady, movie stars and the most influential people in America. One day he would become a star- Mao's last dancer, and the darling of the West. Since its release in 2003, Mao's Last Dancer has sold all around the world and been made into a major motion picture. Like millions of other peasants' lives, it was a story that nearly vanished amidst revolution and chaos. It's a story of courage, a mother's love, a young boy's longing for freedom - a beautiful, rich account of an inspirational life, told with honesty, dignity and pride.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781760899219'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1760899216'}]",False,False,530,Juvenile Nonfiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K2j-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K2j-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,Random House Australia

Schloss,"B-boying is a form of Afro-diasporic competitive dance that developed in the Bronx, NY in the early 1970s. Widely - though incorrectly - known as ""breakdancing,"" it is often dismissed as a form of urban acrobatics set to music. In reality, however, b-boying is a deeply traditional and profoundly expressive art form that has been passed down from teacher to student for almost four decades. Foundation: B-boys, B-girls and Hip-Hop Culture in New York offers the first serious study of b-boying as both unique dance form and a manifestation of the most fundamental principles of hip-hop culture. Drawing on anthropological and historical research, interviews and personal experience as a student of the dance, Joseph Schloss presents a nuanced picture of b-boying and its social context. From the dance's distinctive musical repertoire and traditional educational approaches to its complex stylistic principles and secret battle strategies, Foundation illuminates a previously unexamined thread in the complex tapestry that is contemporary hip-hop.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780199715312'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0199715319'}]",True,True,187,Music,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FpN7wdie9lwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FpN7wdie9lwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,518.24,INR,259.12,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FpN7wdie9lwC&rdid=book-FpN7wdie9lwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2009,Oxford University Press

Ready to Fly is the true story of Sylvia Townsend, an African American girl who falls in love with ballet after seeing Swan Lake on TV. This nonfiction picture book is an excellent choice to share at home or in the classroom. Although there aren't many ballet schools that will accept a girl like Sylvia in the 1950s, her local bookmobile provides another possibility. A librarian helps Sylvia find a book about ballet and the determined seven-year-old, with the help of her new books, starts teaching herself the basics of classical ballet. Soon Sylvia learns how to fly--how to dance--and how to dare to dream. Includes a foreword from Sylvia Townsend, a brief history of the bookmobile, an author's note, and a further reading list.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '006288879X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062888792'}]",False,False,0,Uncategorized,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-0cpzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-0cpzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2023,HarperCollins

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition software. Complete with all Illustrations from the 1937 edition. Mabel Elsworth Todd is considered the founder of what has come to be known as 'Ideokinesis', a form of somatic education that became popular in the 1930s amongst dancers and health professionals. Todd's ideas involved using anatomically based, creative visual imagery and consciously relaxed volition to create and refine neuromuscular coordination. Lulu Sweigard, who coined the term Ideokinesis, and Barbara Clark furthered Todd's work. Todd's work was published in her book The Thinking Body (1937), which is now considered by modern dance schools to be a classic study of physiology and the psychology of movement. Her work influenced many somatic awareness professionals of her day, and is often cited along with The Feldenkrais method for its focus on the subtle influence of unconscious intention and attention.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1684228824'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781684228829'}]",False,False,0,Performing Arts,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pOSq0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pOSq0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2024,Unknown Publisher

It has a fairytale quality, setting a dreamlike world alongside the horror of real lives; in other words, it's like a lullaby, but one that will make you stay awake."" -- Eka Kurniawan, author of Beauty is a Wound A young girl is abducted and smuggled aboard a boat bound upstream on an Indonesian river, through a landscape scarred by ecological destruction and historical greed. As her captors take her ever deeper into the jungle, her uncertain fate is compounded by the sense of her environment as a place of violence, destruction and jeopardy. But it is also a place from which she herself is indigenous, and if she can root herself back into its landscape and languages, she may yet save herself. Khairani Barokka addresses issues of pollution, consumerism, and habitat destruction with a poet's sensibility, and her frenetic neon artwork, inspired by contemporary glitch artists while also incorporating traditional motifs, aims to overturn our ideas of the jungle as a place of threatening darkness.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '191128455X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781911284550'}]",False,False,0,Poetry,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3f3fzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3f3fzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2020,Unknown Publisher

XD-ZzgEACAAJ,dance,Bird Arsonist,No Subtitle,"Tom Prime, Gary Barwin","Written with four hands, by Tom Prime and the Giller Prize and Governor General's Award shortlisted Gary Barwin, Bird Arsonist is avant-garde, tragicomic poetry at its most arresting. They say the language of birds is the closest to that of the divine. They also say poetry is the unacknowledged legislator of the world. In Bird Arsonist, Tom Prime and Gary Barwin -- like all good avant-gardists -- flip these commonplaces on their heads, showing that poetry sets alight any transparent, easy, lawful language, or is precisely what language spits out as it turns to ash. Compressed to the point of implosion, the poems that make up this volume are contorted descendants of Dadaism, Surrealism, and every other -ism. Prime and Barwin confront poetry's contemporary preference for confession and today's digitization of reality not only by -- as they are two -- using a doubled ""I,"" but also by letting language elide the human-all-too-human hand of authorship tout court. The author of Bird Arsonist is language itself, sonorous and fragmentary. Prime and Barwin have merely done the job of giving it the room to speak, of keeping it infected, of making visible the outline of its splinters and its cuts.

XN7UCwAAQBAJ,dance,The Bone Collection,Four Novellas,Kathy Reichs,"A collection of pulse-pounding tales featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan—including the untold story of her first case! This ebook edition contains a special preview of Kathy Reichs’s upcoming novel Two Nights. The #1 New York Times bestselling author behind the hit Fox series Bones, Kathy Reichs is renowned for chilling suspense and fascinating forensic detail. The Bone Collection presents her trademark artistry in this collection of thrilling short fiction. In First Bones, a prequel to Reichs’s first novel, Déjà Dead, she at last reveals the tale of how Tempe became a forensic anthropologist. In this never-before-published story, Tempe recalls the case that lured her from a promising career in academia into the grim but addictive world of criminal investigation. (It all began with a visit from a pair of detectives—and a John Doe recovered from an arson scene in a trailer.) The collection is rounded out with three more stories that take Tempe from the low country of the Florida Everglades, where she makes a grisly discovery in the stomach of an eighteen-foot Burmese python, to the heights of Mount Everest, where a frozen corpse is unearthed. No matter where she goes, Tempe’s cases make for the most gripping reading. Praise for Kathy Reichs and the Temperance Brennan series “Nobody does forensics thrillers like Kathy Reichs. She’s the real deal.”—David Baldacci “Kathy Reichs writes smart—no, make that brilliant—mysteries that are as realistic as nonfiction and as fast-paced as the best thrillers about Jack Reacher or Alex Cross.”—James Patterson “Every minute in the morgue with Tempe is golden.”—The New York Times Book Review","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780399593239'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0399593233'}]",True,False,310,Fiction,en,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XN7UCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XN7UCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,USD,0.0,USD,No Link,2016,Bantam

vVfBoQEACAAJ,dance,John Durang,Man of the American Stage,Lynn Matluck Brooks,"In the memoirs of no other contemporary theater personality (i.e., William Dunlap, Edward Cape Everard, James Fennell, William Wood), has a figure quite like John Durang emerged. His eagerness in grasping opportunities, expanding his skills, shaping his career, and establishing a home are unique, not only in themselves, but also in his articulation of these enterprises. Looking at his life through the lens of American national development illuminates the role of the theater in this critical and ongoing process, while also revealing the forms and repertory that shaped this theater. Remarkably few significant biographies are available of American dance and theatrical figures whose lives preceded the twentieth century. A small handful of memoirs by actors of the period fill in a small part of this gap, but memoirs-like John Durang's-need context and connections to be fully appreciated. The role of dance and theater in shaping the young United States is highlighted in this biography.John Durang: Man of the American Stage by Professor Lynn Matluck Brooks serves both general and theater-educated readerships.
